For other uses, see Breathing system\n\nThe respiratory system (also respiratory apparatus, ventilatory system) is a biological system consisting of specific organs and structures used for gas exchange in animals and plants. The anatomy and physiology that make this happen varies greatly, depending on the size of the organism, the environment in which it lives and its evolutionary history. In land animals, the respiratory surface is internalized as linings of the lungs.[1] Gas exchange in the lungs occurs in millions of small air sacs; in mammals and reptiles, these are called alveoli, and in birds, they are known as atria. These microscopic air sacs have a very rich blood supply, thus bringing the air into close contact with the blood.[2] These air sacs communicate with the external environment via a system of airways, or hollow tubes, of which the largest is the trachea, which branches in the middle of the chest into the two main bronchi. These enter the lungs where they branch into progressively narrower secondary and tertiary bronchi that branch into numerous smaller tubes, the bronchioles. In birds, the bronchioles are termed parabronchi. It is the bronchioles, or parabronchi that generally open into the microscopic alveoli in mammals and atria in birds. Air has to be pumped from the environment into the alveoli or atria by the process of breathing which involves the muscles of respiration.\n\nIn most fish, and a number of other aquatic animals (both vertebrates and invertebrates), the respiratory system consists of gills, which are either partially or completely external organs, bathed in the watery environment. This water flows over the gills by a variety of active or passive means. Gas exchange takes place in the gills which consist of thin or very flat filaments and lammellae which expose a very large surface area of highly vascularized tissue to the water.\n\nOther animals, such as insects, have respiratory systems with very simple anatomical features, and in amphibians, even the skin plays a vital role in gas exchange. Plants also have respiratory systems but the directionality of gas exchange can be opposite to that in animals. The respiratory system in plants includes anatomical features such as stomata, that are found in various parts of the plant.[3]\n\nMammals\n\nAnatomy\n\nFig. 1. Respiratory system\n\nIn humans and other mammals, the anatomy of a typical respiratory system is the respiratory tract. The tract is divided into an upper and a lower respiratory tract. The upper tract includes the nose, nasal cavities, sinuses, pharynx and the part of the larynx above the vocal folds. The lower tract (Fig. 2.) includes the lower part of the larynx, the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles and the alveoli.\n\nThe branching airways of the lower tract are often described as the respiratory tree or tracheobronchial tree (Fig. 2).[4] The intervals between successive branch points along the various branches of \"tree\" are often referred to as branching \"generations\", of which there are, in the adult human, about 23. The earlier generations (approximately generations 0–16), consisting of the trachea and the bronchi, as well as the larger bronchioles which simply act as air conduits, bringing air to the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and alveoli (approximately generations 17–23), where gas exchange takes place.[5][6] Bronchioles are defined as the small airways lacking any cartilaginous support.[4]\n\nThe first bronchi to branch from the trachea are the right and left main bronchi. Second, only in diameter to the trachea (1.8 cm), these bronchi (1–1.4 cm in diameter)[5] enter the lungs at each hilum, where they branch into narrower secondary bronchi known as lobar bronchi, and these branch into narrower tertiary bronchi known as segmental bronchi. Further divisions of the segmental bronchi (1 to 6 mm in diameter)[7] are known as 4th order, 5th order, and 6th order segmental bronchi, or grouped together as subsegmental bronchi.[8][9]\n\nCompared to the 23 number (on average) of branchings of the respiratory tree in the adult human, the mouse has only about 13 such branchings.\n\nThe alveoli are the dead end terminals of the \"tree\", meaning that any air that enters them has to exit via the same route. A system such as this creates dead space, a volume of air (about 150 ml in the adult human) that fills the airways after exhalation and is breathed back into the alveoli before environmental air reaches them.[10][11] At the end of inhalation, the airways are filled with environmental air, which is exhaled without coming in contact with the gas exchanger.[10]\n\nVentilatory volumes\n\nFig. 3 Output of a 'spirometer'. Upward movement of the graph, read from the left, indicates the intake of air; downward movements represent exhalation.\n\nThe lungs expand and contract during the breathing cycle, drawing air in and out of the lungs. The volume of air moved in or out of the lungs under normal resting circumstances (the resting tidal volume of about 500 ml), and volumes moved during maximally forced inhalation and maximally forced exhalation are measured in humans by spirometry.[12] A typical adult human spirogram with the names given to the various excursions in volume the lungs can undergo is illustrated below (Fig. 3):\n\nNot all the air in the lungs can be expelled during maximally forced exhalation (ERV). This is the residual volume (volume of air remaining even after a forced exhalation) of about 1.0–1.5 liters which cannot be measured by spirometry. Volumes that include the residual volume (i.e. functional residual capacity of about 2.5–3.0 liters, and total lung capacity of about 6 liters) can therefore also not be measured by spirometry. Their measurement requires special techniques.[12]\n\nThe rates at which air is breathed in or out, either through the mouth or nose or into or out of the alveoli are tabulated below, together with how they are calculated. The number of breath cycles per minute is known as the respiratory rate. An average healthy human breathes 12–16 times a minute.\n\nMeasurement Equation Description Minute ventilation tidal volume * respiratory rate the total volume of air entering, or leaving, the nose or mouth per minute or normal respiration. Alveolar ventilation (tidal volume – dead space) * respiratory rate the volume of air entering or leaving the alveoli per minute. Dead space ventilation dead space * respiratory rate the volume of air that does not reach the alveoli during inhalation, but instead remains in the airways, per minute.\n\nMechanics of breathing\n\nFig. 6 Real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest movements of human thorax during breathing\n\nThe \"pump handle\" and \"bucket handle movements\" of the ribs Fig. 4 The effect of the The effect of the muscles of inhalation in expanding the rib cage . The particular action illustrated here is called the pump handle movement of the rib cage. Fig. 5 In this view of the rib cage the downward slope of the lower ribs from the midline outwards can be clearly seen. This allows a movement similar to the \"pump handle effect\", but in this case, it is called the In this view of the rib cage the downward slope of the lower ribs from the midline outwards can be clearly seen. This allows a movement similar to the \"pump handle effect\", but in this case, it is called the bucket handle movement . The color of the ribs refers to their classification, and is not relevant here.\n\nBreathing Fig. 7 The muscles of breathing at rest: inhalation on the left, exhalation on the right. Contracting muscles are shown in red; relaxed muscles in blue. Contraction of the The muscles of breathing at rest: inhalation on the left, exhalation on the right. Contracting muscles are shown in red; relaxed muscles in blue. Contraction of the diaphragm generally contributes the most to the expansion of the chest cavity (light blue). However, at the same time, the intercostal muscles pull the ribs upwards (their effect is indicated by arrows) also causing the rib cage to expand during inhalation (see diagram on other side of the page). The relaxation of all these muscles during exhalation causes the rib cage and abdomen (light green) to elastically return to their resting positions. Compare with Fig. 6, the MRI video of the chest movements during the breathing cycle. Fig. 8 The muscles of forceful breathing (inhalation and exhalation). The color code is the same as on the left. In addition to a more forceful and extensive contraction of the diaphragm, the intercostal muscles are aided by the accessory muscles of inhalation to exaggerate the movement of the ribs upwards, causing a greater expansion of the rib cage. During exhalation, apart from the relaxation of the muscles of inhalation, the abdominal muscles actively contract to pull the lower edges of the rib cage downwards decreasing the volume of the rib cage, while at the same time pushing the diaphragm upwards deep into the thorax.\n\nIn mammals, inhalation at rest is primarily due to the contraction of the diaphragm. This is an upwardly domed sheet of muscle that separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity. When it contracts, the sheet flattens, (i.e. moves downwards as shown in Fig. 7) increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity in the antero-posterior axis. The contracting diaphragm pushes the abdominal organs downwards. But because the pelvic floor prevents the lowermost abdominal organs from moving in that direction, the pliable abdominal contents cause the belly to bulge outwards to the front and sides, because the relaxed abdominal muscles do not resist this movement (Fig. 7). This entirely passive bulging (and shrinking during exhalation) of the abdomen during normal breathing is sometimes referred to as \"abdominal breathing\", although it is, in fact, \"diaphragmatic breathing\", which is not visible on the outside of the body. Mammals only use their abdominal muscles during forceful exhalation (see Fig. 8, and discussion below). Never during any form of inhalation.\n\nAs the diaphragm contracts, the rib cage is simultaneously enlarged by the ribs being pulled upwards by the intercostal muscles as shown in Fig. 4. All the ribs slant downwards from the rear to the front (as shown in Fig. 4); but the lowermost ribs also slant downwards from the midline outwards (Fig. 5). Thus the rib cage's transverse diameter can be increased in the same way as the antero-posterior diameter is increased by the so-called pump handle movement shown in Fig. 4.\n\nThe enlargement of the thoracic cavity's vertical dimension by the contraction of the diaphragm, and its two horizontal dimensions by the lifting of the front and sides of the ribs, causes the intrathoracic pressure to fall. The lungs' interiors are open to the outside air and being elastic, therefore expand to fill the increased space, pleura fluid between double-layered pleura covering of lungs helps in reducing friction while lungs expand and contract. The inflow of air into the lungs occurs via the respiratory airways (Fig. 2). In a healthy person, these airways begin with the nose.[13][14] (It is possible to begin with the mouth, which is the backup breathing system. However, chronic mouth breathing leads to, or is a sign of, illness.[15][16][17]) It ends in the microscopic dead-end sacs called alveoli, which are always open, though the diameters of the various sections can be changed by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The alveolar air pressure is therefore always close to atmospheric air pressure (about 100 kPa at sea level) at rest, with the pressure gradients because of lungs contraction and expansion cause air to move in and out of the lungs during breathing rarely exceeding 2–3 kPa.[18][19]\n\nDuring exhalation, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax. This returns the chest and abdomen to a position determined by their anatomical elasticity. This is the \"resting mid-position\" of the thorax and abdomen (Fig. 7) when the lungs contain their functional residual capacity of air (the light blue area in the right hand illustration of Fig. 7), which in the adult human has a volume of about 2.5–3.0 liters (Fig. 3).[6] Resting exhalation lasts about twice as long as inhalation because the diaphragm relaxes passively more gently than it contracts actively during inhalation.\n\nFig. 9 The changes in the composition of the alveolar air during a normal breathing cycle at rest. The scale on the left, and the blue line, indicate the partial pressures of carbon dioxide in kPa, while that on the right and the red line, indicate the partial pressures of oxygen, also in kPa (to convert kPa into mm Hg, multiply by 7.5).\n\nThe volume of air that moves in or out (at the nose or mouth) during a single breathing cycle is called the tidal volume. In a resting adult human, it is about 500 ml per breath. At the end of exhalation, the airways contain about 150 ml of alveolar air which is the first air that is breathed back into the alveoli during inhalation.[10][20] This volume air that is breathed out of the alveoli and back in again is known as dead space ventilation, which has the consequence that of the 500 ml breathed into the alveoli with each breath only 350 ml (500 ml – 150 ml = 350 ml) is fresh warm and moistened air.[6] Since this 350 ml of fresh air is thoroughly mixed and diluted by the air that remains in the alveoli after a normal exhalation (i.e. the functional residual capacity of about 2.5–3.0 liters), it is clear that the composition of the alveolar air changes very little during the breathing cycle (see Fig. 9). The oxygen tension (or partial pressure) remains close to 13–14 kPa (about 100 mm Hg), and that of carbon dioxide very close to 5.3 kPa (or 40 mm Hg). This contrasts with composition of the dry outside air at sea level, where the partial pressure of oxygen is 21 kPa (or 160 mm Hg) and that of carbon dioxide 0.04 kPa (or 0.3 mmHg).[6]\n\nDuring heavy breathing (hyperpnea), as, for instance, during exercise, inhalation is brought about by a more powerful and greater excursion of the contracting diaphragm than at rest (Fig. 8). In addition, the \"accessory muscles of inhalation\" exaggerate the actions of the intercostal muscles (Fig. 8). These accessory muscles of inhalation are muscles that extend from the cervical vertebrae and base of the skull to the upper ribs and sternum, sometimes through an intermediary attachment to the clavicles.[6] When they contract, the rib cage's internal volume is increased to a far greater extent than can be achieved by contraction of the intercostal muscles alone. Seen from outside the body, the lifting of the clavicles during strenuous or labored inhalation is sometimes called clavicular breathing, seen especially during asthma attacks and in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nDuring heavy breathing, exhalation is caused by relaxation of all the muscles of inhalation. But now, the abdominal muscles, instead of remaining relaxed (as they do at rest), contract forcibly pulling the lower edges of the rib cage downwards (front and sides) (Fig. 8). This not only drastically decreases the size of the rib cage, but also pushes the abdominal organs upwards against the diaphragm which consequently bulges deeply into the thorax (Fig. 8). The end-exhalatory lung volume is now well below the resting mid-position and contains far less air than the resting \"functional residual capacity\". However, in a normal mammal, the lungs cannot be emptied completely. In an adult human, there is always still at least 1 liter of residual air left in the lungs after maximum exhalation.[6]\n\nThe automatic rhythmical breathing in and out, can be interrupted by coughing, sneezing (forms of very forceful exhalation), by the expression of a wide range of emotions (laughing, sighing, crying out in pain, exasperated intakes of breath) and by such voluntary acts as speech, singing, whistling and the playing of wind instruments. All of these actions rely on the muscles described above, and their effects on the movement of air in and out of the lungs.\n\nAlthough not a form of breathing, the Valsalva maneuver involves the respiratory muscles. It is, in fact, a very forceful exhalatory effort against a tightly closed glottis, so that no air can escape from the lungs.[21] Instead, abdominal contents are evacuated in the opposite direction, through orifices in the pelvic floor. The abdominal muscles contract very powerfully, causing the pressure inside the abdomen and thorax to rise to extremely high levels. The Valsalva maneuver can be carried out voluntarily but is more generally a reflex elicited when attempting to empty the abdomen during, for instance, difficult defecation, or during childbirth. Breathing ceases during this maneuver.\n\nGas exchange\n\nMechanism of gas exchange Fig. 11 A highly diagrammatic illustration of the process of gas exchange in the mammalian lungs, emphasizing the differences between the gas compositions of the ambient air, the alveolar air (light blue) with which the pulmonary capillary blood equilibrates, and the blood gas tensions in the pulmonary arterial (blue blood entering the lung on the left) and venous blood (red blood leaving the lung on the right). All the gas tensions are in kPa. To convert to mm Hg, multiply by 7.5. Fig. 12 A diagrammatic histological cross-section through a portion of lung tissue showing a normally inflated ml of blood. A diagrammatic histological cross-section through a portion of lung tissue showing a normally inflated alveolus (at the end of a normal exhalation), and its walls containing the pulmonary capillaries (shown in cross-section). This illustrates how the pulmonary capillary blood is completely surrounded by alveolar air. In a normal human lung, all the alveoli together contain about 3 liters of alveolar air. All the pulmonary capillaries contain about 100ml of blood.\n\nFig. 10 A histological cross-section through an alveolar wall showing the layers through which the gases have to move between the blood plasma and the alveolar air. The dark blue objects are the nuclei of the capillary endothelial and alveolar type I epithelial cells (or type 1 pneumocytes). The two red objects labeled \"RBC\" are red blood cells in the pulmonary capillary blood.\n\nThe primary purpose of the respiratory system is the equalizing of the partial pressures of the respiratory gases in the alveolar air with those in the pulmonary capillary blood (Fig. 11). This process occurs by simple diffusion,[22] across a very thin membrane (known as the blood–air barrier), which forms the walls of the pulmonary alveoli (Fig. 10). It consists of the alveolar epithelial cells, their basement membranes and the endothelial cells of the alveolar capillaries (Fig. 10).[23] This blood gas barrier is extremely thin (in humans, on average, 2.2 μm thick). It is folded into about 300 million small air sacs called alveoli[23] (each between 75 and 300 μm in diameter) branching off from the respiratory bronchioles in the lungs, thus providing an extremely large surface area (approximately 145 m2) for gas exchange to occur.[23]\n\nThe air contained within the alveoli has a semi-permanent volume of about 2.5–3.0 liters which completely surrounds the alveolar capillary blood (Fig. 12). This ensures that equilibration of the partial pressures of the gases in the two compartments is very efficient and occurs very quickly. The blood leaving the alveolar capillaries and is eventually distributed throughout the body therefore has a partial pressure of oxygen of 13–14 kPa (100 mmHg), and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 5.3 kPa (40 mmHg) (i.e. the same as the oxygen and carbon dioxide gas tensions as in the alveoli).[6] As mentioned in the section above, the corresponding partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the ambient (dry) air at sea level are 21 kPa (160 mmHg) and 0.04 kPa (0.3 mmHg) respectively.[6]\n\nThis marked difference between the composition of the alveolar air and that of the ambient air can be maintained because the functional residual capacity is contained in dead-end sacs connected to the outside air by fairly narrow and relatively long tubes (the airways: nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi and their branches down to the bronchioles), through which the air has to be breathed both in and out (i.e. there is no unidirectional through-flow as there is in the bird lung). This typical mammalian anatomy combined with the fact that the lungs are not emptied and re-inflated with each breath (leaving a substantial volume of air, of about 2.5–3.0 liters, in the alveoli after exhalation), ensures that the composition of the alveolar air is only minimally disturbed when the 350 ml of fresh air is mixed into it with each inhalation. Thus the animal is provided with a very special \"portable atmosphere\", whose composition differs significantly from the present-day ambient air.[24] It is this portable atmosphere (the functional residual capacity) to which the blood and therefore the body tissues are exposed – not to the outside air.\n\nThe resulting arterial partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide are homeostatically controlled. A rise in the arterial partial pressure of CO 2 and, to a lesser extent, a fall in the arterial partial pressure of O 2 , will reflexly cause deeper and faster breathing until the blood gas tensions in the lungs, and therefore the arterial blood, return to normal. The converse happens when the carbon dioxide tension falls, or, again to a lesser extent, the oxygen tension rises: the rate and depth of breathing are reduced until blood gas normality is restored.\n\nSince the blood arriving in the alveolar capillaries has a partial pressure of O 2 of, on average, 6 kPa (45 mmHg), while the pressure in the alveolar air is 13–14 kPa (100 mmHg), there will be a net diffusion of oxygen into the capillary blood, changing the composition of the 3 liters of alveolar air slightly. Similarly, since the blood arriving in the alveolar capillaries has a partial pressure of CO 2 of also about 6 kPa (45 mmHg), whereas that of the alveolar air is 5.3 kPa (40 mmHg), there is a net movement of carbon dioxide out of the capillaries into the alveoli. The changes brought about by these net flows of individual gases into and out of the alveolar air necessitate the replacement of about 15% of the alveolar air with ambient air every 5 seconds or so. This is very tightly controlled by the monitoring of the arterial blood gases (which accurately reflect composition of the alveolar air) by the aortic and carotid bodies, as well as by the blood gas and pH sensor on the anterior surface of the medulla oblongata in the brain. There are also oxygen and carbon dioxide sensors in the lungs, but they primarily determine the diameters of the bronchioles and pulmonary capillaries, and are therefore responsible for directing the flow of air and blood to different parts of the lungs.\n\nIt is only as a result of accurately maintaining the composition of the 3 liters of alveolar air that with each breath some carbon dioxide is discharged into the atmosphere and some oxygen is taken up from the outside air. If more carbon dioxide than usual has been lost by a short period of hyperventilation, respiration will be slowed down or halted until the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide has returned to 5.3 kPa (40 mmHg). It is therefore strictly speaking untrue that the primary function of the respiratory system is to rid the body of carbon dioxide \"waste\". The carbon dioxide that is breathed out with each breath could probably be more correctly be seen as a byproduct of the body's extracellular fluid carbon dioxide and pH homeostats\n\nIf these homeostats are compromised, then a respiratory acidosis, or a respiratory alkalosis will occur. In the long run these can be compensated by renal adjustments to the H+ and HCO 3 − concentrations in the plasma; but since this takes time, the hyperventilation syndrome can, for instance, occur when agitation or anxiety cause a person to breathe fast and deeply thus causing a distressing respiratory alkalosis through the blowing off of too much CO 2 from the blood into the outside air.[25]\n\nOxygen has a very low solubility in water, and is therefore carried in the blood loosely combined with hemoglobin. The oxygen is held on the hemoglobin by four ferrous iron-containing heme groups per hemoglobin molecule. When all the heme groups carry one O 2 molecule each the blood is said to be \"saturated\" with oxygen, and no further increase in the partial pressure of oxygen will meaningfully increase the oxygen concentration of the blood. Most of the carbon dioxide in the blood is carried as bicarbonate ions (HCO 3 −) in the plasma. However the conversion of dissolved CO 2 into HCO 3 − (through the addition of water) is too slow for the rate at which the blood circulates through the tissues on the one hand, and through alveolar capillaries on the other. The reaction is therefore catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme inside the red blood cells.[26] The reaction can go in both directions depending on the prevailing partial pressure of CO 2 .[6] A small amount of carbon dioxide is carried on the protein portion of the hemoglobin molecules as carbamino groups. The total concentration of carbon dioxide (in the form of bicarbonate ions, dissolved CO 2 , and carbamino groups) in arterial blood (i.e. after it has equilibrated with the alveolar air) is about 26 mM (or 58 ml/100 ml),[27] compared to the concentration of oxygen in saturated arterial blood of about 9 mM (or 20 ml/100 ml blood).[6]\n\nControl of ventilation\n\nVentilation of the lungs in mammals occurs via the respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata and the pons of the brainstem.[6] These areas form a series of neural pathways which receive information about the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. This information determines the average rate of ventilation of the alveoli of the lungs, to keep these pressures constant. The respiratory center does so via motor nerves which activate the diaphragm and other muscles of respiration.\n\nThe breathing rate increases when the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood increases. This is detected by central blood gas chemoreceptors on the anterior surface of the medulla oblongata.[6] The aortic and carotid bodies, are the peripheral blood gas chemoreceptors which are particularly sensitive to the arterial partial pressure of O 2 though they also respond, but less strongly, to the partial pressure of CO 2 .[6] At sea level, under normal circumstances, the breathing rate and depth, is determined primarily by the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide rather than by the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, which is allowed to vary within a fairly wide range before the respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata and pons respond to it to change the rate and depth of breathing.[6]\n\nExercise increases the breathing rate due to the extra carbon dioxide produced by the enhanced metabolism of the exercising muscles.[28] In addition, passive movements of the limbs also reflexively produce an increase in the breathing rate.[6][28]\n\nInformation received from stretch receptors in the lungs' limits tidal volume (the depth of inhalation and exhalation).\n\nResponses to low atmospheric pressures\n\nThe alveoli are open (via the airways) to the atmosphere, with the result that alveolar air pressure is exactly the same as the ambient air pressure at sea level, at altitude, or in any artificial atmosphere (e.g. a diving chamber, or decompression chamber) in which the individual is breathing freely. With expansion of the lungs the alveolar air occupies a larger volume, and its pressure falls proportionally, causing air to flow in through the airways, until the pressure in the alveoli is again at the ambient air pressure. The reverse happens during exhalation. This process (of inhalation and exhalation) is exactly the same at sea level, as on top of Mt. Everest, or in a diving chamber or decompression chamber.\n\nFig. 14 A graph showing the relationship between total atmospheric pressure and altitude above sea level\n\nHowever, as one rises above sea level the density of the air decreases exponentially (see Fig. 14), halving approximately with every 5500 m rise in altitude.[29] Since the composition of the atmospheric air is almost constant below 80 km, as a result of the continuous mixing effect of the weather, the concentration of oxygen in the air (mmols O 2 per liter of ambient air) decreases at the same rate as the fall in air pressure with altitude.[30] Therefore, in order to breathe in the same amount of oxygen per minute, the person has to inhale a proportionately greater volume of air per minute at altitude than at sea level. This is achieved by breathing deeper and faster (i.e. hyperpnea) than at sea level (see below).\n\nFig. 13 Aerial photo of Mount Everest from the south, behind Nuptse and Lhotse\n\nThere is, however, a complication that increases the volume of air that needs to be inhaled per minute (respiratory minute volume) to provide the same amount of oxygen to the lungs at altitude as at sea level. During inhalation, the air is warmed and saturated with water vapor during its passage through the nose passages and pharynx. Saturated water vapor pressure is dependent only on temperature. At a body core temperature of 37 °C it is 6.3 kPa (47.0 mmHg), irrespective of any other influences, including altitude.[31] Thus at sea level, where the ambient atmospheric pressure is about 100 kPa, the moistened air that flows into the lungs from the trachea consists of water vapor (6.3 kPa), nitrogen (74.0 kPa), oxygen (19.7 kPa) and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases (a total of 100 kPa). In dry air the partial pressure of O 2 at sea level is 21.0 kPa (i.e. 21% of 100 kPa), compared to the 19.7 kPa of oxygen entering the alveolar air. (The tracheal partial pressure of oxygen is 21% of [100 kPa – 6.3 kPa] = 19.7 kPa). At the summit of Mt. Everest (at an altitude of 8,848 m or 29,029 ft), the total atmospheric pressure is 33.7 kPa, of which 7.1 kPa (or 21%) is oxygen.[29] The air entering the lungs also has a total pressure of 33.7 kPa, of which 6.3 kPa is, unavoidably, water vapor (as it is at sea level). This reduces the partial pressure of oxygen entering the alveoli to 5.8 kPa (or 21% of [33.7 kPa – 6.3 kPa] = 5.8 kPa). The reduction in the partial pressure of oxygen in the inhaled air is therefore substantially greater than the reduction of the total atmospheric pressure at altitude would suggest (on Mt Everest: 5.8 kPa vs. 7.1 kPa).\n\nA further minor complication exists at altitude. If the volume of the lungs were to be instantaneously doubled at the beginning of inhalation, the air pressure inside the lungs would be halved. This happens regardless of altitude. Thus, halving of the sea level air pressure (100 kPa) results in an intrapulmonary air pressure of 50 kPa. Doing the same at 5500 m, where the atmospheric pressure is only 50 kPa, the intrapulmonary air pressure falls to 25 kPa. Therefore, the same change in lung volume at sea level results in a 50 kPa difference in pressure between the ambient air and the intrapulmonary air, whereas it result in a difference of only 25 kPa at 5500 m. The driving pressure forcing air into the lungs during inhalation is therefore halved at this altitude. The rate of inflow of air into the lungs during inhalation at sea level is therefore twice that which occurs at 5500 m. However, in reality, inhalation and exhalation occur far more gently and less abruptly than in the example given. The differences between the atmospheric and intrapulmonary pressures, driving air in and out of the lungs during the breathing cycle, are in the region of only 2–3 kPa.[18][19] A doubling or more of these small pressure differences could be achieved only by very major changes in the breathing effort at high altitudes.\n\nAll of the above influences of low atmospheric pressures on breathing are accommodated primarily by breathing deeper and faster (hyperpnea). The exact degree of hyperpnea is determined by the blood gas homeostat, which regulates the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. This homeostat prioritizes the regulation of the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide over that of oxygen at sea level.[6] That is to say, at sea level the arterial partial pressure of CO 2 is maintained at very close to 5.3 kPa (or 40 mmHg) under a wide range of circumstances, at the expense of the arterial partial pressure of O 2 , which is allowed to vary within a very wide range of values, before eliciting a corrective ventilatory response. However, when the atmospheric pressure (and therefore the partial pressure of O 2 in the ambient air) falls to below 50–75% of its value at sea level, oxygen homeostasis is given priority over carbon dioxide homeostasis.[6] This switch-over occurs at an elevation of about 2500 m (or about 8000 ft). If this switch occurs relatively abruptly, the hyperpnea at high altitude will cause a severe fall in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, with a consequent rise in the pH of the arterial plasma. This is one contributor to high altitude sickness. On the other hand, if the switch to oxygen homeostasis is incomplete, then hypoxia may complicate the clinical picture with potentially fatal results.\n\nThere are oxygen sensors in the smaller bronchi and bronchioles. In response to low partial pressures of oxygen in the inhaled air these sensors reflexively cause the pulmonary arterioles to constrict.[32] (This is the exact opposite of the corresponding reflex in the tissues, where low arterial partial pressures of O 2 cause arteriolar vasodilation.) At altitude this causes the pulmonary arterial pressure to rise resulting in a much more even distribution of blood flow to the lungs than occurs at sea level. At sea level, the pulmonary arterial pressure is very low, with the result that the tops of the lungs receive far less blood than the bases, which are relatively over-perfused with blood. It is only in the middle of the lungs that the blood and air flow to the alveoli are ideally matched. At altitude, this variation in the ventilation/perfusion ratio of alveoli from the tops of the lungs to the bottoms is eliminated, with all the alveoli perfused and ventilated in more or less the physiologically ideal manner. This is a further important contributor to the acclimatatization to high altitudes and low oxygen pressures.\n\nThe kidneys measure the oxygen content (mmol O 2 /liter blood, rather than the partial pressure of O 2 ) of the arterial blood. When the oxygen content of the blood is chronically low, as at high altitude, the oxygen-sensitive kidney cells secrete erythropoietin (EPO) into the blood.[33][34] This hormone stimulates the red bone marrow to increase its rate of red cell production, which leads to an increase in the hematocrit of the blood, and a consequent increase in its oxygen carrying capacity (due to the now high hemoglobin content of the blood). In other words, at the same arterial partial pressure of O 2 , a person with a high hematocrit carries more oxygen per liter of blood than a person with a lower hematocrit does. High altitude dwellers therefore have higher hematocrits than sea-level residents.[34][35]\n\nOther functions of the lungs\n\nLocal defenses\n\nIrritation of nerve endings within the nasal passages or airways, can induce a cough reflex and sneezing. These responses cause air to be expelled forcefully from the trachea or nose, respectively. In this manner, irritants caught in the mucus which lines the respiratory tract are expelled or moved to the mouth where they can be swallowed.[6] During coughing, contraction of the smooth muscle in the airway walls narrows the trachea by pulling the ends of the cartilage plates together and by pushing soft tissue into the lumen. This increases the expired airflow rate to dislodge and remove any irritant particle or mucus.\n\nRespiratory epithelium can secrete a variety of molecules that aid in the defense of the lungs. These include secretory immunoglobulins (IgA), collectins, defensins and other peptides and proteases, reactive oxygen species, and reactive nitrogen species. These secretions can act directly as antimicrobials to help keep the airway free of infection. A variety of chemokines and cytokines are also secreted that recruit the traditional immune cells and others to the site of infections.\n\nSurfactant immune function is primarily attributed to two proteins: SP-A and SP-D. These proteins can bind to sugars on the surface of pathogens and thereby opsonize them for uptake by phagocytes. It also regulates inflammatory responses and interacts with the adaptive immune response. Surfactant degradation or inactivation may contribute to enhanced susceptibility to lung inflammation and infection.[36]\n\nMost of the respiratory system is lined with mucous membranes that contain mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, which produces white blood cells such as lymphocytes.\n\nPrevention of alveolar collapse\n\nThe lungs make a surfactant, a surface-active lipoprotein complex (phospholipoprotein) formed by type II alveolar cells. It floats on the surface of the thin watery layer which lines the insides of the alveoli, reducing the water's surface tension.\n\nThe surface tension of a watery surface (the water-air interface) tends to make that surface shrink.[6] When that surface is curved as it is in the alveoli of the lungs, the shrinkage of the surface decreases the diameter of the alveoli. The more acute the curvature of the water-air interface the greater the tendency for the alveolus to collapse.[6] This has three effects. Firstly, the surface tension inside the alveoli resists expansion of the alveoli during inhalation (i.e. it makes the lung stiff, or non-compliant). Surfactant reduces the surface tension and therefore makes the lungs more compliant, or less stiff, than if it were not there. Secondly, the diameters of the alveoli increase and decrease during the breathing cycle. This means that the alveoli have a greater tendency to collapse (i.e. cause atelectasis) at the end of exhalation than at the end of inhalation. Since surfactant floats on the watery surface, its molecules are more tightly packed together when the alveoli shrink during exhalation.[6] This causes them to have a greater surface tension-lowering effect when the alveoli are small than when they are large (as at the end of inhalation, when the surfactant molecules are more widely spaced). The tendency for the alveoli to collapse is therefore almost the same at the end of exhalation as at the end of inhalation. Thirdly, the surface tension of the curved watery layer lining the alveoli tends to draw water from the lung tissues into the alveoli. Surfactant reduces this danger to negligible levels, and keeps the alveoli dry.[6][37]\n\nPre-term babies who are unable to manufacture surfactant have lungs that tend to collapse each time they breathe out. Unless treated, this condition, called respiratory distress syndrome, is fatal. Basic scientific experiments, carried out using cells from chicken lungs, support the potential for using steroids as a means of furthering the development of type II alveolar cells.[38] In fact, once a premature birth is threatened, every effort is made to delay the birth, and a series of steroid injections is frequently administered to the mother during this delay in an effort to promote lung maturation.[39]\n\nContributions to whole body functions\n\nThe lung vessels contain a fibrinolytic system that dissolves clots that may have arrived in the pulmonary circulation by embolism, often from the deep veins in the legs. They also release a variety of substances that enter the systemic arterial blood, and they remove other substances from the systemic venous blood that reach them via the pulmonary artery. Some prostaglandins are removed from the circulation, while others are synthesized in the lungs and released into the blood when lung tissue is stretched.\n\nThe lungs activate one hormone. The physiologically inactive decapeptide angiotensin I is converted to the aldosterone-releasing octapeptide, angiotensin II, in the pulmonary circulation. The reaction occurs in other tissues as well, but it is particularly prominent in the lungs. Angiotensin II also has a direct effect on arteriolar walls, causing arteriolar vasoconstriction, and consequently a rise in arterial blood pressure.[40] Large amounts of the angiotensin-converting enzyme responsible for this activation are located on the surfaces of the endothelial cells of the alveolar capillaries. The converting enzyme also inactivates bradykinin. Circulation time through the alveolar capillaries is less than one second, yet 70% of the angiotensin I reaching the lungs is converted to angiotensin II in a single trip through the capillaries. Four other peptidases have been identified on the surface of the pulmonary endothelial cells.\n\nVocalization\n\nThe movement of gas through the larynx, pharynx and mouth allows humans to speak, or phonate. Vocalization, or singing, in birds occurs via the syrinx, an organ located at the base of the trachea. The vibration of air flowing across the larynx (vocal cords), in humans, and the syrinx, in birds, results in sound. Because of this, gas movement is vital for communication purposes.\n\nTemperature control\n\nPanting in dogs, cats, birds and some other animals provides a means of reducing body temperature, by evaporating saliva in the mouth (instead of evaporating sweat on the skin).\n\nClinical significance\n\nDisorders of the respiratory system can be classified into several general groups:\n\nDisorders of the respiratory system are usually treated by a pulmonologist and respiratory therapist.\n\nWhere there is an inability to breathe or insufficiency in breathing, a medical ventilator may be used.\n\nExceptional mammals\n\nCetaceans\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Cetacea § Respiration Cetaceans have lungs, which means that they breathe air. An individual can last without a breath from a few minutes to over two hours depending on the species. Whales are deliberate breathers: they must be awake to inhale and exhale. When stale air, warmed from the lungs, is exhaled, it condenses as it meets colder external air. As with a terrestrial mammal breathing out on a cold day, a small cloud of 'steam' appears. This is called the 'spout' and varies across species in shape, angle and height. Species can be identified at a distance using this characteristic. The structure of the respiratory and The structure of the respiratory and circulatory systems is of particular importance for the life of marine mammals . The oxygen balance is effective. Each breath can replace up to 90% of the total lung volume. For land mammals, in comparison, this value is usually about 15%. During inhalation, about twice as much oxygen is absorbed by the lung tissue as in a land mammal. As with all mammals, the oxygen is stored in the blood and the lungs, but in cetaceans, it is also stored in various tissues, mainly in the muscles. Here, this happens through the muscle pigment, myoglobin , provides an effective bond. This additional oxygen storage is vital for deep diving, since beyond a depth around 100 m (330 ft), the lung tissue is almost completely compressed by the water pressure.\n\nHorses\n\nHorses are obligate nasal breathers which means that they are different from many other mammals because they do not have the option of breathing through their mouths and must take in air through their noses. A flap of tissue called the soft palate blocks off the pharynx from the mouth (oral cavity) of the horse, except when swallowing. This helps to prevent the horse from inhaling food, but does not allow use of the mouth to breathe when in respiratory distress, a horse can only breathe through its nostrils.[citation needed]\n\nElephants\n\nThe elephant is the only mammal known to have no pleural space. Instead, the parietal and visceral pleura are both composed of dense connective tissue and joined to each other via loose connective tissue.[41] This lack of a pleural space, along with an unusually thick diaphragm, are thought to be evolutionary adaptations allowing the elephant to remain underwater for long periods while breathing through its trunk which emerges as a snorkel.[42]\n\nIn the elephant the lungs are attached to the diaphragm and breathing relies mainly on the diaphragm rather than the expansion of the ribcage.[43]\n\nBirds\n\nFig. 15 The arrangement of the air sacs and lungs in birds\n\nFig. 16 The anatomy of bird's respiratory system, showing the relationships of the trachea, primary and intra-pulmonary bronchi, the dorso- and ventro-bronchi, with the parabronchi running between the two. The posterior and anterior air sacs are also indicated, but not to scale.\n\nThe respiratory system of birds differs significantly from that found in mammals. Firstly, they have rigid lungs which do not expand and contract during the breathing cycle. Instead an extensive system of air sacs (Fig. 15) distributed throughout their bodies act as the bellows drawing environmental air into the sacs, and expelling the spent air after it has passed through the lungs (Fig. 18).[44] Birds also do not have diaphragms or pleural cavities.\n\nBird lungs are smaller than those in mammals of comparable size, but the air sacs account for 15% of the total body volume, compared to the 7% devoted to the alveoli which act as the bellows in mammals.[45]\n\nInhalation and exhalation are brought about by alternately increasing and decreasing the volume of the entire thoraco-abdominal cavity (or coelom) using both their abdominal and costal muscles.[46][47][48] During inhalation the muscles attached to the vertebral ribs (Fig. 17) contract angling them forwards and outwards. This pushes the sternal ribs, to which they are attached at almost right angles, downwards and forwards, taking the sternum (with its prominent keel) in the same direction (Fig. 17). This increases both the vertical and transverse diameters of thoracic portion of the trunk. The forward and downward movement of, particularly, the posterior end of the sternum pulls the abdominal wall downwards, increasing the volume of that region of the trunk as well.[46] The increase in volume of the entire trunk cavity reduces the air pressure in all the thoraco-abdominal air sacs, causing them to fill with air as described below.\n\nDuring exhalation the external oblique muscle which is attached to the sternum and vertebral ribs anteriorly, and to the pelvis (pubis and ilium in Fig. 17) posteriorly (forming part of the abdominal wall) reverses the inhalatory movement, while compressing the abdominal contents, thus increasing the pressure in all the air sacs. Air is therefore expelled from the respiratory system in the act of exhalation.[46]\n\nFig. 19 The cross-current respiratory gas exchanger in the lungs of birds. Air is forced from the air sacs unidirectionally (from right to left in the diagram) through the parabronchi. The pulmonary capillaries surround the parabronchi in the manner shown (blood flowing from below the parabronchus to above it in the diagram). [ 46 ] [ 49 ] Blood or air with a high oxygen content is shown in red; oxygen-poor air or blood is shown in various shades of purple-blue.\n\nDuring inhalation air enters the trachea via the nostrils and mouth, and continues to just beyond the syrinx at which point the trachea branches into two primary bronchi, going to the two lungs (Fig. 16). The primary bronchi enter the lungs to become the intrapulmonary bronchi, which give off a set of parallel branches called ventrobronchi and, a little further on, an equivalent set of dorsobronchi (Fig. 16).[46] The ends of the intrapulmonary bronchi discharge air into the posterior air sacs at the caudal end of the bird. Each pair of dorso-ventrobronchi is connected by a large number of parallel microscopic air capillaries (or parabronchi) where gas exchange occurs (Fig. 16).[46] As the bird inhales, tracheal air flows through the intrapulmonary bronchi into the posterior air sacs, as well as into the dorsobronchi, but not into the ventrobronchi (Fig. 18). This is due to the bronchial architecture which directs the inhaled air away from the openings of the ventrobronchi, into the continuation of the intrapulmonary bronchus towards the dorsobronchi and posterior air sacs.[50][51][52] From the dorsobronchi the inhaled air flows through the parabronchi (and therefore the gas exchanger) to the ventrobronchi from where the air can only escape into the expanding anterior air sacs. So, during inhalation, both the posterior and anterior air sacs expand,[46] the posterior air sacs filling with fresh inhaled air, while the anterior air sacs fill with \"spent\" (oxygen-poor) air that has just passed through the lungs.\n\nFig. 18 Inhalation-exhalation cycle in birds\n\nDuring exhalation the pressure in the posterior air sacs (which were filled with fresh air during inhalation) increases due to the contraction of the oblique muscle described above. The aerodynamics of the interconnecting openings from the posterior air sacs to the dorsobronchi and intrapulmonary bronchi ensures that the air leaves these sacs in the direction of the lungs (via the dorsobronchi), rather than returning down the intrapulmonary bronchi (Fig. 18).[50][52] From the dorsobronchi the fresh air from the posterior air sacs flows through the parabronchi (in the same direction as occurred during inhalation) into ventrobronchi. The air passages connecting the ventrobronchi and anterior air sacs to the intrapulmonary bronchi direct the \"spent\", oxygen poor air from these two organs to the trachea from where it escapes to the exterior.[46] Oxygenated air therefore flows constantly (during the entire breathing cycle) in a single direction through the parabronchi.[53]\n\nThe blood flow through the bird lung is at right angles to the flow of air through the parabronchi, forming a cross-current flow exchange system (Fig. 19).[44][46][49] The partial pressure of oxygen in the parabronchi declines along their lengths as O 2 diffuses into the blood. The blood capillaries leaving the exchanger near the entrance of airflow take up more O 2 than do the capillaries leaving near the exit end of the parabronchi. When the contents of all capillaries mix, the final partial pressure of oxygen of the mixed pulmonary venous blood is higher than that of the exhaled air,[46][49] but is nevertheless less than half that of the inhaled air,[46] thus achieving roughly the same systemic arterial blood partial pressure of oxygen as mammals do with their bellows-type lungs.[46]\n\nThe trachea is an area of dead space: the oxygen-poor air it contains at the end of exhalation is the first air to re-enter the posterior air sacs and lungs. In comparison to the mammalian respiratory tract, the dead space volume in a bird is, on average, 4.5 times greater than it is in mammals of the same size.[45][46] Birds with long necks will inevitably have long tracheae, and must therefore take deeper breaths than mammals do to make allowances for their greater dead space volumes. In some birds (e.g. the whooper swan, Cygnus cygnus, the white spoonbill, Platalea leucorodia, the whooping crane, Grus americana, and the helmeted curassow, Pauxi pauxi) the trachea, which some cranes can be 1.5 m long,[46] is coiled back and forth within the body, drastically increasing the dead space ventilation.[46] The purpose of this extraordinary feature is unknown.\n\nReptiles\n\nFig. 20 X-ray video of a female American alligator while breathing\n\nThe anatomical structure of the lungs is less complex in reptiles than in mammals, with reptiles lacking the very extensive airway tree structure found in mammalian lungs. Gas exchange in reptiles still occurs in alveoli however.[44] Reptiles do not possess a diaphragm. Thus, breathing occurs via a change in the volume of the body cavity which is controlled by contraction of intercostal muscles in all reptiles except turtles. In turtles, contraction of specific pairs of flank muscles governs inhalation and exhalation.[54]\n\nAmphibians\n\nBoth the lungs and the skin serve as respiratory organs in amphibians. The ventilation of the lungs in amphibians relies on positive pressure ventilation. Muscles lower the floor of the oral cavity, enlarging it and drawing in air through the nostrils into the oral cavity. With the nostrils and mouth closed, the floor of the oral cavity is then pushed up, which forces air down the trachea into the lungs. The skin of these animals is highly vascularized and moist, with moisture maintained via secretion of mucus from specialised cells, and is involved in cutaneous respiration. While the lungs are of primary organs for gas exchange between the blood and the environmental air (when out of the water), the skin's unique properties aid rapid gas exchange when amphibians are submerged in oxygen-rich water.[55] Some amphibians have gills, either in the early stages of their development (e.g. tadpoles of frogs), while others retain them into adulthood (e.g. some salamanders).[44]\n\nFish\n\nFig. 21. The operculum or gill cover of a pike has been pulled open to expose the gill arches bearing filaments.\n\nFig. 22. A comparison between the operations and effects of a cocurrent and a countercurrent flow exchange system is depicted by the upper and lower diagrams respectively. In both, it is assumed that red has a higher value (e.g. of temperature or the partial pressure of a gas) than blue and that the property being transported in the channels, therefore, flows from red to blue. In fish a countercurrent flow (lower diagram) of blood and water in the gills is used to extract oxygen from the environment. [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ]\n\nFig. 23 The respiratory mechanism in bony fish. The inhalatory process is on the left, the exhalatory process on the right. The movement of water is indicated by the blue arrows.\n\nOxygen is poorly soluble in water. Fully aerated fresh water therefore contains only 8–10 ml O 2 /liter compared to the O 2 concentration of 210 ml/liter in the air at sea level.[59] Furthermore, the coefficient of diffusion (i.e. the rate at which a substances diffuses from a region of high concentration to one of low concentration, under standard conditions) of the respiratory gases is typically 10,000 faster in air than in water.[59] Thus oxygen, for instance, has a diffusion coefficient of 17.6 mm2/s in air, but only 0.0021 mm2/s in water.[60][61][62][63] The corresponding values for carbon dioxide are 16 mm2/s in air and 0.0016 mm2/s in water.[62][63] This means that when oxygen is taken up from the water in contact with a gas exchanger, it is replaced considerably more slowly by the oxygen from the oxygen-rich regions small distances away from the exchanger than would have occurred in air. Fish have developed gills deal with these problems. Gills are specialized organs containing filaments, which further divide into lamellae. The lamellae contain a dense thin walled capillary network that exposes a large gas exchange surface area to the very large volumes of water passing over them.[64]\n\nGills use a countercurrent exchange system that increases the efficiency of oxygen-uptake from the water.[56][57][58] Fresh oxygenated water taken in through the mouth is uninterruptedly \"pumped\" through the gills in one direction, while the blood in the lamellae flows in the opposite direction, creating the countercurrent blood and water flow (Fig. 22), on which the fish's survival depends.[58]\n\nWater is drawn in through the mouth by closing the operculum (gill cover), and enlarging the mouth cavity (Fig. 23). Simultaneously the gill chambers enlarge, producing a lower pressure there than in the mouth causing water to flow over the gills.[58] The mouth cavity then contracts, inducing the closure of the passive oral valves, thereby preventing the back-flow of water from the mouth (Fig. 23).[58][65] The water in the mouth is, instead, forced over the gills, while the gill chambers contract emptying the water they contain through the opercular openings (Fig. 23). Back-flow into the gill chamber during the inhalatory phase is prevented by a membrane along the ventroposterior border of the operculum (diagram on the left in Fig. 23). Thus the mouth cavity and gill chambers act alternately as suction pump and pressure pump to maintain a steady flow of water over the gills in one direction.[58] Since the blood in the lamellar capillaries flows in the opposite direction to that of the water, the consequent countercurrent flow of blood and water maintains steep concentration gradients for oxygen and carbon dioxide along the entire length of each capillary (lower diagram in Fig. 22). Oxygen is, therefore, able to continually diffuse down its gradient into the blood, and the carbon dioxide down its gradient into the water.[57] Although countercurrent exchange systems theoretically allow an almost complete transfer of a respiratory gas from one side of the exchanger to the other, in fish less than 80% of the oxygen in the water flowing over the gills is generally transferred to the blood.[56]\n\nIn certain active pelagic sharks, water passes through the mouth and over the gills while they are moving, in a process known as \"ram ventilation\".[66] While at rest, most sharks pump water over their gills, as most bony fish do, to ensure that oxygenated water continues to flow over their gills. But a small number of species have lost the ability to pump water through their gills and must swim without rest. These species are obligate ram ventilators and would presumably asphyxiate if unable to move. Obligate ram ventilation is also true of some pelagic bony fish species.[67]\n\nThere are a few fish that can obtain oxygen for brief periods of time from air swallowed from above the surface of the water. Thus lungfish possess one or two lungs, and the labyrinth fish have developed a special \"labyrinth organ\", which characterizes this suborder of fish. The labyrinth organ is a much-folded suprabranchial accessory breathing organ. It is formed by a vascularized expansion of the epibranchial bone of the first gill arch, and is used for respiration in air.[68] This organ allows labyrinth fish to take in oxygen directly from the air, instead of taking it from the water in which they reside through the use of gills. The labyrinth organ helps the oxygen in the inhaled air to be absorbed into the bloodstream. As a result, labyrinth fish can survive for a short period of time out of water, as they can inhale the air around them, provided they stay moist. Labyrinth fish are not born with functional labyrinth organs. The development of the organ is gradual and most juvenile labyrinth fish breathe entirely with their gills and develop the labyrinth organs when they grow older.[68]\n\nInvertebrates\n\nArthropods\n\nSome species of crab use a respiratory organ called a branchiostegal lung.[69] Its gill-like structure increases the surface area for gas exchange which is more suited to taking oxygen from the air than from water. Some of the smallest spiders and mites can breathe simply by exchanging gas through the surface of the body. Larger spiders, scorpions and other arthropods use a primitive book lung.\n\nInsects\n\nMost insects breath passively through their spiracles (special openings in the exoskeleton) and the air reaches every part of the body by means of a series of smaller and smaller tubes called 'trachaea' when their diameters are relatively large, and 'tracheoles' when their diameters are very small. The tracheoles make contact with individual cells throughout the body.[44] They are partially filled with fluid, which can be withdrawn from the individual tracheoles when the tissues, such as muscles, are active and have a high demand for oxygen, bringing the air closer to the active cells.[44] This is probably brought about by the buildup of lactic acid in the active muscles causing an osmotic gradient, moving the water out of the tracheoles and into the active cells. Diffusion of gases is effective over small distances but not over larger ones, this is one of the reasons insects are all relatively small. Insects which do not have spiracles and trachaea, such as some Collembola, breathe directly through their skins, also by diffusion of gases.[70]\n\nThe number of spiracles an insect has is variable between species, however, they always come in pairs, one on each side of the body, and usually one pair per segment. Some of the Diplura have eleven, with four pairs on the thorax, but in most of the ancient forms of insects, such as Dragonflies and Grasshoppers there are two thoracic and eight abdominal spiracles. However, in most of the remaining insects, there are fewer. It is at the level of the tracheoles that oxygen is delivered to the cells for respiration.\n\nInsects were once believed to exchange gases with the environment continuously by the simple diffusion of gases into the tracheal system. More recently, however, large variation in insect ventilatory patterns has been documented and insect respiration appears to be highly variable. Some small insects do not demonstrate continuous respiratory movements and may lack muscular control of the spiracles. Others, however, utilize muscular contraction of the abdomen along with coordinated spiracle contraction and relaxation to generate cyclical gas exchange patterns and to reduce water loss into the atmosphere. The most extreme form of these patterns is termed discontinuous gas exchange cycles.[71]\n\nMolluscs\n\nMolluscs generally possess gills that allow gas exchange between the aqueous environment and their circulatory systems. These animals also possess a heart that pumps blood containing hemocyanin as its oxygen-capturing molecule.[44] Hence, this respiratory system is similar to that of vertebrate fish. The respiratory system of gastropods can include either gills or a lung.\n\nPlants\n\nPlants use carbon dioxide gas in the process of photosynthesis, and exhale oxygen gas as waste. The chemical equation of photosynthesis is 6 CO 2 (carbon dioxide) and 6 H 2 O (water), which in the presence of sunlight makes C 6 H 12 O 6 (glucose) and 6 O 2 (oxygen). Photosynthesis uses electrons on the carbon atoms as the repository for the energy obtained from sunlight.[72] Respiration is the opposite of photosynthesis. It reclaims the energy to power chemical reactions in cells. In so doing the carbon atoms and their electrons are combined with oxygen forming CO 2 which is easily removed from both the cells and the organism. Plants use both processes, photosynthesis to capture the energy and oxidative metabolism to use it.\n\nPlant respiration is limited by the process of diffusion. Plants take in carbon dioxide through holes, known as stomata, that can open and close on the undersides of their leaves and sometimes other parts of their anatomy. Most plants require some oxygen for catabolic processes (break-down reactions that release energy). But the quantity of O 2 used per hour is small as they are not involved in activities that require high rates of aerobic metabolism. Their requirement for air, however, is very high as they need CO 2 for photosynthesis, which constitutes only 0.04% of the environmental air. Thus, to make 1 g of glucose requires the removal of all the CO 2 from at least 18.7 liters of air at sea level. But inefficiencies in the photosynthetic process cause considerably greater volumes of air to be used.[72][73]\n\nSee also"

The human respiratory system has the following main structures – Nose, mouth, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs. Explore in detail.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRespiratory System Definition\n\n“Human Respiratory System is a network of organs and tissues that helps us breathe. The primary function of this system is to introduce oxygen into the body and expel carbon dioxide from the body.”\n\nWhat is the Respiratory System?\n\nAs defined above, the human respiratory system consists of a group of organs and tissues that help us to breathe. Aside from the lungs, there are also muscles and a vast network of blood vessels that facilitate the process of respiration.\n\nAlso Read: Mechanism of Breathing\n\nHuman Respiratory System Diagram\n\nTo gain a clearer understanding, we have illustrated the human respiratory system and its different parts involved in the process.\n\nFeatures of the Human Respiratory System\n\nThe respiratory system in humans has the following important features:\n\nThe energy is generated by the breakdown of glucose molecules in all living cells of the human body.\n\nOxygen is inhaled and is transported to various parts and are used in the process of burning food particles (breaking down glucose molecules) at the cellular level in a series of chemical reactions.\n\nThe obtained glucose molecules are used for discharging energy in the form of ATP- (adenosine triphosphate)\n\nAlso Read: Difference between trachea and oesophagus\n\nRespiratory System Parts and Functions\n\nLet us have a detailed look at the different parts of the respiratory system and their functions.\n\nNose\n\nHumans have exterior nostrils, which are divided by a framework of cartilaginous structure called the septum. This is the structure that separates the right nostril from the left nostril. Tiny hair follicles that cover the interior lining of nostrils act as the body’s first line of defence against foreign pathogens. Furthermore, they provide additional humidity for inhaled air.\n\nLarynx\n\nTwo cartilaginous chords lay the framework for the larynx. It is found in front of the neck and is responsible for vocals as well as aiding respiration. Hence, it is also informally called the voice box. When food is swallowed, a flap called the epiglottis folds over the top of the windpipe and prevents food from entering into the larynx.\n\nAlso check: What is the role of epiglottis and diaphragm in respiration?\n\nPharynx\n\nThe nasal chambers open up into a wide hollow space called the pharynx. It is a common passage for air as well as food. It functions by preventing the entry of food particles into the windpipe. The epiglottis is an elastic cartilage, which serves as a switch between the larynx and the oesophagus by allowing the passage of air into the lungs, and food in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nHave you ever wondered why we cough when we eat or swallow?\n\nTalking while we eat or swallow may sometimes result in incessant coughing. The reason behind this reaction is the epiglottis. It is forced to open for the air to exit outwards and the food to enter into the windpipe, triggering a cough.\n\nTrachea\n\nThe trachea or the windpipe rises below the larynx and moves down to the neck. The walls of the trachea comprise C-shaped cartilaginous rings which give hardness to the trachea and maintain it by completely expanding. The trachea extends further down into the breastbone and splits into two bronchi, one for each lung.\n\nBronchi\n\nThe trachea splits into two tubes called the bronchi, which enter each lung individually. The bronchi divide into secondary and tertiary bronchioles, and it further branches out into small air-sacs called the alveoli. The alveoli are single-celled sacs of air with thin walls. It facilitates the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide molecules into or away from the bloodstream.\n\nLungs\n\nLungs are the primary organs of respiration in humans and other vertebrates. They are located on either side of the heart, in the thoracic cavity of the chest. Anatomically, the lungs are spongy organs with an estimates total surface area between 50 to 75 sq meters. The primary function of the lungs is to facilitate the exchange of gases between the blood and the air. Interestingly, the right lung is quite bigger and heavier than the left lung.\n\nAlso Read: Respiration\n\nRespiratory Tract\n\nThe respiratory tract in humans is made up of the following parts:\n\nExternal nostrils – For the intake of air.\n\n– For the intake of air.

Lungs – Humans have a pair of lungs, which are sac-like structures and covered by a double-layered membrane known as pleura.\n\nAir is inhaled with the help of nostrils, and in the nasal cavity, the air is cleansed by the fine hair follicles present within them. The cavity also has a group of blood vessels that warm the air. This air then passes to the pharynx, then to the larynx and into the trachea.\n\nThe trachea and the bronchi are coated with ciliated epithelial cells and goblet cells (secretory cells) which discharge mucus to moisten the air as it passes through the respiratory tract. It also traps the fine bits of dust or pathogen that escaped the hair in the nasal openings. The motile cilia beat in an ascending motion, such that the mucus and other foreign particles are carried back to the buccal cavity where it may either be coughed out (or swallowed.)\n\nOnce the air reaches the bronchus, it moves into the bronchioles, and then into the alveoli.\n\nRespiratory System Functions\n\nThe functions of the human respiratory system are as follows:\n\nInhalation and Exhalation\n\nThe respiratory system helps in breathing (also known as pulmonary ventilation.) The air inhaled through the nose moves through the pharynx, larynx, trachea and into the lungs. The air is exhaled back through the same pathway. Changes in the volume and pressure in the lungs aid in pulmonary ventilation.\n\nExchange of Gases between Lungs and Bloodstream\n\nInside the lungs, the oxygen and carbon dioxide enter and exit respectively through millions of microscopic sacs called alveoli. The inhaled oxygen diffuses into the pulmonary capillaries, binds to haemoglobin and is pumped through the bloodstream. The carbon dioxide from the blood diffuses into the alveoli and is expelled through exhalation.\n\nAlso read: Exchange Of Gases in Plants\n\nExchange of Gases between Bloodstream and Body Tissues\n\nThe blood carries the oxygen from the lungs around the body and releases the oxygen when it reaches the capillaries. The oxygen is diffused through the capillary walls into the body tissues. The carbon dioxide also diffuses into the blood and is carried back to the lungs for release.\n\nThe Vibration of the Vocal Cords\n\nWhile speaking, the muscles in the larynx move the arytenoid cartilage. These cartilages push the vocal cords together. During exhalation, when the air passes through the vocal cords, it makes them vibrate and creates sound.\n\nOlfaction or Smelling\n\nDuring inhalation, when the air enters the nasal cavities, some chemicals present in the air bind to it and activate the receptors of the nervous system on the cilia. The signals are sent to the olfactory bulbs via the brain.\n\nAlso Read: Respiratory System Disorders\n\nRespiration is one of the metabolic processes which plays an essential role in all living organisms. However, lower organisms like the unicellular do not “breathe” like humans – intead, they utilise the process of diffusion. Annelids like earthworms have a moist cuticle which helps them in gaseous exchange. Respiration in fish occurs through special organs called gills. Most of the higher organisms possess a pair of lungs for breathing.\n\nAlso Read: Amphibolic Pathway\n\nTo learn more about respiration, check out the video below:\n\nFrequently Asked Questions Q1 What is the human respiratory system?

    "main_content": "Human respiratory system\n\nThe human respiratory system is the set of tissues and organs responsible for exchanging oxygen from the surrounding environment with carbon dioxide produced in the body. The major parts of a person’s respiratory system are the lungs, the diaphragm, the trachea (also called the windpipe), the bronchi or bronchial tubes, the mouth, and the nose. The diaphragm is a muscle that lies horizontally under the lungs; when it relaxes, it presses upward on the lungs, which, being essentially large sacs of porous tissue, compress and thereby expel carbon dioxide that the body has produced as waste. Once the carbon dioxide has been expelled, the diaphragm contracts and the lungs expand downward, filling up with oxygen-rich air from the atmosphere. The lungs then filter the air to remove the oxygen and transfer it to the bloodstream, simultaneously extracting carbon dioxide from the bloodstream in a process called gas exchange. The oxygenated blood then circulates throughout the body due to the pumping of the heart, bringing oxygen to the body’s tissues and organs and carrying away carbon dioxide so that it can be returned to the lungs and exhaled.\n\nBackground\n\nIn many ways, the human respiratory system is little more than a gas-exchange mechanism. Because this mechanism is located inside the body, air from the atmosphere must be carried from the surrounding space and into the body. This is done via conducting passages that connect different parts of the respiratory system to one another and allow the air to flow in and out. These passages are called airways, and they are usually divided into the upper airways and the lower airways; the division between the two systems is designated as the point where the esophagus and the trachea branch off from one another at the top of a person’s throat. The upper airways are the parts above this point and include the nose, the mouth, the sinuses, and the pharynx, or upper part of the throat. The lower airways include the larynx (also called the voice box), the trachea, and the bronchi, which connect the trachea to the lungs.\n\nThe inner functions of the lungs are the central feature of the process of respiration. Air that is breathed in travels into the body through the nose or mouth, flows down the trachea, and enters the bronchi. There are two bronchi, one leading from the trachea to each lung. After leaving the bronchi, the air flows into the lungs, reaching smaller, narrower passages known as bronchioles. At the end of the bronchioles are small air sacs, almost like tiny versions of the lung itself, called alveoli. The alveoli act like tiny air filters; fresh air full of oxygen is pushed into them until it passes through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries that surround them. Once the oxygen enters the capillaries it can then be carried throughout the body by the network of blood vessels.\n\nA person’s lungs and the thoracic cavity that contains them are impressive examples of the way that organisms evolve to solve particular structural problems. The lungs need to be able to expand and contract as air is inhaled and then exhaled, so they require an enclosure that allows them to maintain their position in the body while still being able to increase and decrease in volume. The lungs are also quite delicate structures, so they need protection from outside forces that might be directed against the body. The design of the thoracic cavity in which the lungs are situated accommodates these competing needs for both strength and flexibility. The ribs that make up the ribcage encase the lungs in a lattice of sturdy bone to protect them from injury. However, to keep this structure from being too rigid and potentially even damaging the lungs it is supposed to protect, the ribs are attached to the sternum by cartilage, firm tissue that is more flexible than bone but stronger than the softer tissue of which organs are composed, and to the thoracic vertebrae in the spinal column by articulated facets. This means that the ribs encircling the lungs can move slightly to allow the lungs to function while still keeping them safe. The lungs expand and contract within the thoracic cavity, protected by two membranes called pleurae. One pleura, called the visceral pleura, encases the lung itself; the other, the parietal pleura, coats the inside of the thoracic cavity. A small amount of fluid flows between the two pleurae to prevent the lungs from rubbing against the inside of the thoracic cavity.\n\nSome illnesses can cause the pleurae to become inflamed, which can make it extremely painful to breathe. In fact, the lungs are so delicate that they can collapse, in much the same way that a balloon collapses if punctured. This can happen when air or fluid enters the thoracic cavity due to an injury, a condition known as pneumothorax; the air or fluid presses on the lung and prevents it from fully inflating.\n\nOverview\n\nA good way of seeing the human respiratory system in action is to follow the way the body responds to strenuous exercise while the activity is occurring. During exercise, the body’s need for energy increases because it is moving more quickly and forcefully than it normally would. This means that there is a greater need for oxygen to enter the bloodstream and for carbon dioxide to be removed from the blood. To provide additional oxygen, the rate of breathing increases so that more breaths are taken per minute and each breath is deeper than it would be if the person were at rest. This increases the amount of oxygen entering the body, but this extra oxygen still needs to reach all of the body’s different parts. To help accomplish this, the heart rate increases along with the increase in the rate of breathing. As the heart beats faster and stronger, it pushes the oxygenated blood out to the body’s extremities much more quickly, making sure that they receive the oxygen-rich blood they need to sustain the exercise.\n\nMeasuring the increase in breathing rate is quite straightforward, as one only needs to count the number of breaths in a specific timeframe during exercise and compare it with the number counted without exercise. Measuring how deep a breath is can be a more complicated undertaking because it requires the use of a special apparatus called a spirometer. To use a spirometer, the person being evaluated must place their lips around a straw-like device and inhale through it. The spirometer measures the volume of air being removed from it and drawn into the lungs. These devices are used not only to monitor and measure respiration but also as a type of respiratory therapy for patients who have had surgery or who are recovering from some type of trauma affecting their respiration. A frequent consequence of these experiences is that the lungs become partially deflated and must therefore be conditioned to return to their full capacity. This can be challenging, especially with children, because breathing is often painful during a recovery period. For this reason, doctors will often use breathing devices to encourage patients to inhale as much as they can to expand their lungs. Most of the devices have a straw one must breathe through and a ball that rises along an enclosed tube as air is pulled out of its chamber. Patients are told to use this device several times per hour and to use their breath to pull hard enough to raise the ball to a designated level.\n\nOne of the major vulnerabilities of the human respiratory system is the possibility of contaminants entering the body in the same way that air does. This could be very dangerous because small particles of matter carried along by the air could damage the delicate structures inside the lungs, cause an infection, or both. The body has several systems in place to help prevent these harms from occurring. Very small hairs grow on the inside of the nose to filter out larger particles such as dust and pollen. Particles that are too small to be captured this way may instead become stuck in the layer of mucus that lines the nasal passages and other airflow conduits. There is also an organ at the back of the throat called the epiglottis, which functions to make sure that food and liquids go down the esophagus to the stomach, rather than traveling down the trachea and potentially into the lungs. When a person swallows, the epiglottis reflexively folds over the trachea to close it off. After the solid or liquid has been swallowed, the epiglottis then pulls back from covering the trachea.\n\nThere are a number of diseases and disorders that can afflict the human respiratory system. One of the most common is pneumonia, which is essentially an infection of the alveoli caused by bacteria. The infection causes fluid to build up in the alveoli, which interferes with the ability of oxygen to pass through the walls of the alveoli and enter the bloodstream. If this process continues long enough, the person may suffer from oxygen deprivation and require supplemental oxygen from an oxygen tank, delivered through a face mask. While not generally fatal, pneumonia can cause death in patients who are very old, very young, or immunocompromised in some fashion.\n\nOne of the symptoms exhibited by a person suffering from pneumonia is coughing, which is one of the primary ways the human respiratory system has of clearing up materials or conditions that are interfering with regular breathing. Coughing occurs when a person inhales a volume of air, closes the glottis (the opening between the vocal folds in the larynx, not to be confused with the epiglottis), forces the inhaled air against the closed glottis under pressure, and then opens the glottis to allow the inhaled air to blast outward. Coughing is used to try to expel foreign matter that has entered into the respiratory system, such as when a person takes a sip of a beverage and the liquid goes down the trachea instead of the esophagus. Coughing can be initiated voluntarily or as a reflex. Voluntary coughing may occur when people wish to clear out obstructing matter from their airway, or it may be done for social reasons, as when one politely coughs to obtain someone’s attention. Involuntary coughing results from a situation that causes the body to attempt to expel matter in the airway to prevent choking or death. An example of involuntary coughing is that which occurs when a person ingests water while drowning.\n\nMany people are unaware of the role played by the human respiratory system in the everyday activity of speech. Human beings communicate in many ways, but speech is the most common, barring conditions that prevent a person from speaking. Speech is the act of creating sounds to signify particular concepts. The respiratory system is critical to the production of vocalized speech because to produce intelligible sounds, one vibrates the vocal cords in the larynx while exhaling to cause air to pass over them. By varying the type of vibration, people are able to change the tone and volume of their speech, producing anything from a whisper to a shout. If the vocal cords become damaged or paralyzed, or if a person experiences difficulty breathing, then speech can be problematic or even impossible. Some injuries and illnesses can cause the muscles that control the vibration of the vocal cords to become paralyzed, such as throat cancer, vocal-cord infections, or accidents affecting the neck and throat.\n\nBibliography\n\nChiras, Daniel D.

(more) See all videos for this article 2 of 2 human nasal cavity Sagittal view of the human nasal cavity. (more)\n\nThe human gas-exchanging organ, the lung, is located in the thorax, where its delicate tissues are protected by the bony and muscular thoracic cage. The lung provides the tissues of the human body with a continuous flow of oxygen and clears the blood of the gaseous waste product, carbon dioxide. Atmospheric air is pumped in and out regularly through a system of pipes, called conducting airways, which join the gas-exchange region with the outside of the body. The airways can be divided into upper and lower airway systems. The transition between the two systems is located where the pathways of the respiratory and digestive systems cross, just at the top of the larynx.\n\nThe upper airway system comprises the nose and the paranasal cavities (or sinuses), the pharynx (or throat), and partly also the oral cavity, since it may be used for breathing. The lower airway system consists of the larynx, the trachea, the stem bronchi, and all the airways ramifying intensively within the lungs, such as the intrapulmonary bronchi, the bronchioles, and the alveolar ducts. For respiration, the collaboration of other organ systems is clearly essential. The diaphragm, as the main respiratory muscle, and the intercostal muscles of the chest wall play an essential role by generating, under the control of the central nervous system, the pumping action on the lung. The muscles expand and contract the internal space of the thorax, the bony framework of which is formed by the ribs and the thoracic vertebrae. The contribution of the lung and chest wall (ribs and muscles) to respiration is described below in The mechanics of breathing. The blood, as a carrier for the gases, and the circulatory system (i.e., the heart and the blood vessels) are mandatory elements of a working respiratory system (see blood; cardiovascular system)."

    "main_content": "VOICEOVER: How we breathe.\n\nBreathing - or ventilation - is the process of taking air into and out of the lungs. When we breathe, air, made up mainly of nitrogen and oxygen, enters our body through the mouth and nose. It travels down the trachea – or windpipe – into one of two bronchi and into bronchioles before entering one of millions of alveoli, where gaseous exchange takes place.\n\nWhen we breathe out, the process is reversed and other gases, now containing less oxygen and more carbon dioxide, leave our lungs. Two important structures for breathing are the intercostal muscles and diaphragm.\n\nAs these muscles contract, the volume in our chest cavity increases, the inside pressure decreases and air moves in. As these muscles relax, the volume in our chest cavity decreases, the inside pressure increases and moves air out.\n\nKatie: That was so fascinating. What's next, Dr Tim?\n\nDr. Tim: All right, next, let's use what we've just heard there to figure out more about how we breathe - or what we should really be saying is how we ventilate. \"Ventilation\" is the scientific word that we use for \"breathing\", and as you know, we take in oxygen into our lungs…\n\nINHALES\n\n…and then expel carbon dioxide out of them.\n\nAnd oxygen is required by every single cell in our bodies for respiration, and we use a number of key parts of the gas exchange system. To do this, they include…\n\nActually, I'll leave this one to you, Katie. No pressure.\n\nKatie: Bring it on. Well, they're on the autocue, so…\n\nDr. Tim: Ohh!\n\nKatie: …on the camera, so I know the answers. Your trachea, your windpipe.\n\nDr. Tim: Yes.\n\nKatie: Bronchi, bronchioles.\n\nDr. Tim: Yep.\n\nKatie: Alveoli, the little air sacs.\n\nDr. Tim: Yep.\n\nKatie: Intercostal muscles.\n\nDr. Tim: Perfect. And there's one more, and it's a really, really important one.\n\nKatie: Ah, yes - the diaphragm. It says it right there!\n\nDr. Tim: Nice. And our ability to control our breathing is a wonderful thing. We're doing it every moment of every day, whether it's playing the saxophone or singing or even scuba-diving, we're all doing it. Ventilation is an absolute must, so it's really important that we understand the science behind it, and there's one thing in particular that's easily mistaken.\n\nKatie: What's that, then, sir?\n\nDr. Tim: It's really important that we understand that we do not suck air into our lungs. Ventilation is a passive process, which occurs naturally, without even thinking about it. It's actually our diaphragm and the intercostal muscles that expands our chest volume and it's this difference in pressure that results in the air moving in and out of the lungs.\n\nAnd I've got a nifty animation here that clearly demonstrates this in action.\n\nSo the gas exchange system is made up of your lungs and your airways. The lungs fill with oxygen-rich air from the atmosphere and this oxygen is then transferred into your blood via the alveoli. Carbon dioxide goes the opposite way. The alveoli pass it from your blood back into your lungs before you exhale it. And the intercostal muscles – they're the ones between your ribs – and the diaphragm – muscular sheet under your lungs – contract and relax to help us breathe.\n\nKatie: Wow, it's absolutely amazing that our bodies do this all the time and we don't even have to think about it.\n\nDr. Tim: It really is amazing and what's also incredible is that our gas exchange system can become more and more efficient when we practise it by leading an active and healthy lifestyle.\n\nKatie: So, with regular exercise, we can take in more oxygen and get rid of more carbon dioxide.\n\nDr. Tim: Absolutely, and that's because our muscles get stronger and our lung capacity increases over time. All it takes is practice and this is why elite athletes can practise at such high levels."

    "title": "Physiology, Respiratory Drive",
    "main_content": "Introduction Breathing is a complex process that relies heavily on the coordinated action of the muscles of respiration and the control center in the brain. The primary function of the lungs is to facilitate gas exchange between inspired air and the circulatory system. It helps bring oxygen to the blood and remove carbon dioxide from the body. Oxygen is critical for proper metabolism on a cellular level, while carbon dioxide is crucial for achieving adequate PH levels. Several mechanisms exist to ensure a rigorous balance between supply and demand. In response to a change in blood gases, the pulmonary system adapts by adjusting breathing patterns to help meet the body's metabolic demand.[1][2] Exercise, for instance, increases oxygen consumption and raises carbon dioxide production. Should, at any point, the available oxygen supply fails to meet the necessary demand, aerobic metabolism ceases, and energy production declines. Likewise, if carbon dioxide accumulates without proper disposal, the blood becomes more acidic, and cellular damage ensues, ultimately leading to organ failure. Neither outcome is desirable; therefore, numerous mechanisms exist to match respiration with the continually changing demands. Central and peripheral chemoreceptors, as well as mechanoreceptors in the lungs, convey neural and sensory input to the brain to help modulate respiratory drive. The respiratory center responds in return by changing its firing pattern to alter breathing rhythm and volume.[3][4]\n\nFunction Each respiratory cycle begins with inspiration and ends with expiration. During inspiration, the diaphragm and the external intercostals contract, causing enlargement of the thoracic cavity. As a result, intra-pleural pressure decreases, and so does alveolar pressure, forcing the lungs to expand and air to move in. However, expiration occurs passively when the diaphragm relaxes, owing to the lungs' elastic properties. The respiratory control system drives respiratory cycles and consists of three components: the central neural respiratory generator, the sensory input system, and the muscular effector system.[5] The rate and strength at which the diaphragm contracts, hence the frequency and volume of respiration, depend heavily on the firing pattern of pacemaker cells in the brainstem. On the other hand, the sensory input system sends signals to the brain to modulate respiratory patterns depending on metabolic demand. Together, these processes aim to optimize the lungs' function of taking in oxygen from the air and expelling carbon dioxide from the body.[6]\n\nMechanism Intrinsic Respiratory drive The respiratory center is composed of three distinct neuronal groups in the brain: the dorsal respiratory group in the nucleus tractus solitarius, the ventral respiratory group in the medulla, and the pontine respiratory group in the pons. The latter is further classified into the pneumotaxic center and the apneustic center. The dorsal respiratory group is mainly inspiratory, while the ventral medullary group is primarily expiratory. The rostral half of the ventral medullary group additionally contains neurons responsible for rhythm generation. Of particular significance is the preBötzinger complex, whose neurons possess neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors, a potential target for many pharmacological, physiological, and anatomical studies. The pontine groupings are responsible for modulating the intensity and frequency of the medullary signals with their pneumotaxic groups limiting inspiration and their apneustic centers prolonging and encouraging inhalation. Each of these groups communicates with one another in a concerted effort as the pace-making potential of respiration.[7][8][9] Thoracic Neural Receptors Mechanoreceptors found in the airways, trachea, lung, and pulmonary vessels provide sensory information to the respiratory center in the brain with regards to lung volume, airway stretch, and vascular congestion. There are two primary types of thoracic sensors: slow adapting stretch spindles and rapid adapting irritant receptors. The former conveys only volume information while the latter additionally responds to irritative chemical triggers such as harmful foreign agents and dust. Both types of mechanoreceptors transmit information to the respiratory center via cranial nerve X (the vagus nerve) to increase the breathing rate, the volume of breathing, or to stimulate cough. A notable example is the Pulmonary stretch reflex, also called the Herring-Breuer reflex, which prevents the lungs from over-inflating by sending inhibitory impulses to the inspiration center. Another type of receptor worth mentioning is the juxta-capillary receptors that respond to vascular congestion and interstitial edema in the lungs by sending signals to the brain to increase the breathing rate. Peripheral Chemoreceptors Peripheral chemoreceptors include the carotid and aortic bodies. The carotid bodies are located at the bifurcation of the common carotid arteries and send information to the respiratory center via cranial nerve IX, the glossopharyngeal nerve. The aortic bodies are situated within the aortic arch and send information to the brain via cranial nerve X, the vagus nerve. While capable of sensing carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions, the peripheral sensory system primarily detects low arterial oxygen levels (hypoxemia). Hypercapnia and acidosis increase the sensitivity of these sensors and, therefore, play a partial role in the receptor's function. The carotid bodies comprise approximately 15% of the total driving force of respiration. In healthy individuals, the respiratory center is more sensitive to rising carbon dioxide sensed by central chemoreceptors than decreasing oxygen levels. Oxygen runs the respiratory center only when there is severe hypoxemia.[10] Central Chemoreceptors Central chemoreceptors in the ventral surface of the medulla and the retrotrapezoid nucleus hold most of the remaining control over the respiratory drive. They primarily sense pH changes in the central nervous system caused by alterations in arterial carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a lipid-soluble molecule that freely diffuses across the blood-brain barrier and forms hydron ions within the cerebrospinal fluid. Chemoreceptors, in turn, respond to pH changes as they become more acidic and send sensory input to the brain to stimulate hyperventilation. The result is a slow and deep breathing pattern that helps eliminate carbon dioxide from the body. Likewise, when arterial PCO2 drops, pH in the cerebrospinal fluid becomes alkalotic, and hypoventilation ensues. Therefore, arterial PCO2 is the chief determinant of the respiratory drive under normal conditions.[5][6][11][12][13][14][15] Integration of Receptor Input Respiratory centers located within the medulla and the pons are responsible for generating the baseline respiratory rhythm. However, an aggregated sensory input from the peripheral sensory system monitoring oxygen levels and the central sensory system monitoring pH modifies the rate and depth of respiration. These signals, along with several other sensory inputs coming from peripheral mechanoreceptors, modulate the respiratory rhythm to create a unified neural signal sent to the primary muscles of respiration. The total input culminates in a respiratory rate of approximately 12 breaths per minute for an average adult while at rest.[5][6][11][12][13][14][15] Respiratory Drive During Sleep A variety of changes in respiratory physiology occur while asleep, especially during the rapid eye movement stage, also referred to as REM sleep. During REM, breathing becomes very irregular with periods of hypopnea, apnea, and a continually changing tidal volume and respiratory rate. Paralysis of all accessory muscles of respiration ensues, and people become diaphragm dependent. Additionally, drive output from the respiratory controller in the brain declines, and the respiratory center becomes less responsive to changes in arterial PO2 and PCO2 as well. Finally, upper respiratory dilator muscles become hypotonic, leading to airway narrowing and increased airway resistance. Even though a healthy person can tolerate breathing changes during sleep, sleep becomes problematic in patients with pre-existing respiratory disease.[16]\n\nRelated Testing Evaluation of Respiratory Drive Assessment of a patient with hypercapnia, hypoxia, or abnormal ventilation should always begin with a thorough history and clinical examination to ascertain a root cause. A variety of tests, including pulmonary function testing, arterial blood gas values, and chest X-rays, may be indicated to determine the primary pathology. Other tests of respiratory control are primarily used for research purposes or under exceptional circumstances when routine tests have failed to explain the abnormal levels of arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. These tests include measuring hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory response, mouth occlusion pressure, elastic and resistive load testing, and analyzing the patient's breathing pattern. However, the harm or discomfort imposed by such tests limits their routine use unless proven to be significantly beneficial.[17][18]\n\nPathophysiology As mentioned previously, the respiratory control center responds to altered levels of CO2 and O2 by changing the respiratory rate and pattern. Interestingly, the response to hypoxia differs from the response to hypercapnia. Hypoxia induces a breathing pattern of rapid and shallow breaths with a relatively higher increase in respiratory rate than tidal volume. The aim is to decrease the cost of breathing by avoiding the need to overcome the lungs' higher elastance at high volumes. In simple terms, breathing with high tidal volumes requires more negative pressure generation in the intra-pleural space and, thus, more oxygen utilization by respiratory muscles, especially in an already hypoxic patient. In contrast, hypercapnia triggers a breathing pattern of deep and slow breaths with a relatively more significant increase in tidal volume than respiratory rate. This pattern aims to limit dead space ventilation and optimize carbon dioxide elimination.\n\nClinical Significance Several conditions induce alterations in respiratory rate or pattern. These modifications occur due to changes in PaO2, PaCO2, or pH levels imposed by the disease process, which in turn augments the sensory drive sent from the central or peripheral control mechanisms to the brain. The adjustments manifest in the form of modified tidal volume or respiratory rate. [10] Asthma Asthma is a chronic obstructive airway disease characterized by reversible inflammation of the conducting airways in response to various allergenic and non-allergenic stimuli. During an acute asthma attack, severe inflammation occurs, leading to airway narrowing, excess mucus production, and bronchoconstriction. Subsequently, hypoxia develops due to impaired gas exchange. Hypoxia stimulates peripheral chemoreceptors, which, in turn, transmit the signal to the respiratory control center in the brain. The respiratory center increases its firing rate leading to enhanced respiratory rate and resultant hypocapnia. It is crucial to note that in asthmatics, paradoxical normalization of carbon dioxide levels is an indication that muscular fatigue is setting in and that total respiratory failure is imminent.[19] Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease COPD is another chronic obstructive airway disease that shares many similarities with asthma. However, COPD is an irreversible process that gradually progresses over time, leading to chronic air-trapping and persistent hypercapnia. At first, central chemoreceptors sense hypercapnia as it would in a healthy individual and signal the respiratory center to increase breathing depth. As a result, a respiratory pattern of deep and slow breaths ensues. Studies have shown that supplemental oxygen during acute COPD exacerbation causes an increase in PaCO2 and a transient decrease in minute ventilation. Previously, it was hypothesized that central chemoreceptors gradually become resistant to carbon dioxide levels in the blood such that the medullary sensors no longer respond to changes in pH as they would in a healthy counterpart. This led to the belief that hypercapnia no longer acts as the primary drive for respiration, and these patients become dependent on hypoxia for respiratory drive, causing generalized reluctance to administer supplemental oxygen during acute COPD exacerbation in the healthcare setting. This theory is no longer widely accepted as studies have shown that the transient decrease in minute ventilation in these patients is not sustained and does not consistently correlate proportionally with the degree of PaCO2 increase. Instead, administration of supplemental oxygen counteracts the reflex hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction that would otherwise shunt perfusion away from the damaged alveoli with poor ventilation to maximize perfusion to the \"good\" alveoli. The resulting dead space ventilation and ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch is likely a better explanation for the oxygen-induced increase in PaCO2. Another proposed mechanism is that supplemental oxygen causes a right shift in the hemoglobin-CO2 dissociation curve, increasing PaCO2, referred to as the Haldane effect. COPD patients with an acute exacerbation have difficulty increasing their minute ventilation to blow off the excess CO2 and therefore struggle to normalize PaCO2 in this setting. Regardless of the specific physiologic mechanism for oxygen-induced hypercapnia, the relevant consensus is that patients with acute COPD exacerbation should be given titrated oxygen therapy with a target of 88-92% oxygen saturation to reduce both hypoxia and the risk of hypercapnia.[20] Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome Obesity hypoventilation syndrome, also known as Pickwickian syndrome, is a condition that affects morbidly obese individuals. Obesity alters lung and chest wall mechanics leading to hypoventilation and resultant hypercapnia. The patient initially compensates by increasing respiratory drive and work of breathing. However, respiratory fatigue rapidly ensures that hypercapnia and hypoxia occur. As the condition progresses, chronic hypercapnia results in respiratory acidosis with compensatory HCO3 retention by the kidneys. Bicarbonate decreases the sensitivity of central chemoreceptors to changes in PCO2, leading to persistent hypercapnia. Neuromuscular Disease Neuromuscular disease is the terminology used to describe the various pathologies that affect muscular function. The problem could arise anywhere along the pathway of muscle control, beginning with the CNS and ending with the muscle itself. Examples include muscular dystrophies, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and motor neuron diseases, such as poliomyelitis. Respiratory muscle weakness eventually occurs in neuromuscular diseases, causing hypoventilation and resultant hypoxia and hypercapnia. The core concept is that respiratory control centers are intact and attempt to respond appropriately to changing PO2 and PCO2 levels. However, the muscles lose the ability to respond to hypoxic and hypercapnic stimuli due to muscular weakness. Unaided, this leads to hypoxia and hypercapnia and, ultimately, death due to ventilatory failure. Drugs Inhalational anesthetics, narcotics, and minor tranquilizers are the most notorious pharmaceuticals for causing respiratory depression. Inhaled anesthetics decrease response to increased carbon dioxide and decreased oxygenation, thus blunting respiratory drive adjustments. Benzodiazepines, on the other hand, act on GABA receptors in the central nervous system. They effectively decrease all neural functions, including the respiratory pacemaking system in the brainstem. Similarly, opioid narcotics act on mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system. They primarily target the preBötzinger complex within the pacemaking system of respiration, thus reducing the underlying drive for breathing. Finally, alcohol is nonpharmaceutical that depresses respiratory drive by blunting the body's response to increasing carbon dioxide levels.[21][22][11] Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, sometimes known as Ondine's curse, is a rare genetic disease caused by a mutation that renders the respiratory center in the brain unresponsive to changes in PCO2. When breathing fails to happen unconsciously, the patient becomes dependent on conscious control (cortex). Patients generally have breathing problems during sleep that tend to get better while awake.[23]"
