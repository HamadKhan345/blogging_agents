    "main_content": "Among all asset classes, Bitcoin has had one of the more volatile trading histories. The cryptocurrency's first significant price increase occurred in October 2010 when the value of a single bitcoin started moving past its long flat price of less than $0.10.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has experienced several massive rallies and spectacular crashes since it first became available. This article offers insight into Bitcoin's volatile history and some reasons why its price acts the way it does.\n\nKey Takeaways Since it was first introduced, Bitcoin has had a choppy and volatile trading history.\n\nBitcoin was designed to be used as currency in daily transactions.\n\nWhile Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, investors have also used it to store value and to hedge against inflation and market uncertainty.\n\nBitcoin's price is a product of supply, demand, and market sentiment.\n\nInvestopedia / Alice Morgan\n\nBitcoin's Price History\n\nThe price changes for Bitcoin generally reflect investor enthusiasm, as well as the demand and supply dynamics in the market. Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous Bitcoin inventor(s), designed it for use in daily transactions, but it has become far more than a payment method.\n\nIt attracted traders who began to bet on its price changes. Investors turned to Bitcoin as a way to store value, generate wealth, and hedge against inflation, and institutions worked to create Bitcoin investment instruments.\n\nBitcoin's price fluctuations are primarily driven by traders and investors who buy and sell aggressively in hopes of catching the next big move. If you're thinking of investing in Bitcoin, be sure to select a reliable cryptocurrency exchange first.\n\nHere's a quick rundown of Bitcoin's price history:\n\n\n\n2009 to 2015\n\nBitcoin had a price of zero when it was introduced in 2009. Its price jumped from its long-held level of $0.10 to $0.20 on Oct. 26, 2010. Before the year had closed out, it had reached $0.30. In 2011, it started growing past $1, reaching a peak of $29.60 on June 8, 2011; however, a sharp recession in cryptocurrency markets followed, and Bitcoin's price dropped, closing the year at about $5.\n\nThe year 2012 proved to be a generally uneventful year for Bitcoin, though it did increase by a few dollars; however, 2013 witnessed strong gains in price. Bitcoin began the year trading at $13, crossed $100 by April, then $200 by October.\n\nThe remainder of the year witnessed historic gains for Bitcoin. It crossed $1,000 in November and closed the 2012 year out at $732.\n\n2016 to 2020\n\nPrices slowly climbed through 2016 to over $900 by the end of the year. In 2017, Bitcoin's price hovered around $1,000 until it broke $2,000 in mid-May and then skyrocketed to close at $19,188 on Dec. 16.\n\nMainstream investors, governments, economists, and scientists took notice, and other entities began developing cryptocurrencies to compete with Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin's price moved sideways in 2018 and 2019, with small bursts of activity. For example, there was a resurgence in price and trading volume in June 2019, with the price surpassing $10,000. However, it fell to a closing price of $6,612 by mid-December.\n\nIn 2020, the economy shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bitcoin's price burst into action once again. The cryptocurrency opened the year at $7,161. The pandemic shutdown and subsequent government policies fed investors' fears about the global economy and accelerated Bitcoin's rise.\n\nAt the close on Nov. 23, Bitcoin was trading for $18,383. Bitcoin's price closed at $28,993 on Dec. 31, 2020, increasing 416% from the start of that year.\n\n2021 to 2023\n\nBitcoin took less than a month in 2021 to smash its 2020 price record, surpassing $40,000 by Jan. 7, 2021. By mid-April, Bitcoin prices reached new all-time highs of over $60,000 as Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, went public. Institutional interest propelled its price further upward, and Bitcoin reached a peak of $64,895 on April 14, 2021.\n\nBy the summer of 2021, however, prices were down by 50%, closing at $30,829 on July 19. September saw another bull run, with BTC scraping $52,956, but a large drawdown took it to a closing price of $40,597 about two weeks later.\n\nOn Nov. 10, 2021, Bitcoin again reached an all-time high of $69,000 before closing at $64,921. In mid-December 2021, Bitcoin fell to a close of $46,211. The price started fluctuating more as uncertainty about inflation and the emergence of a new variant of COVID-19, Omicron, continued to spook investors.\n\nBetween January and May 2022, Bitcoin's price continued to gradually decline, with closing prices only reaching $47,459 by the end of March before falling further to $29,000 on May 11. This was the first time since July 2021 that Bitcoin closed under $30,000.\n\nOn June 13, crypto prices plunged, dropping below $23,000 for the first time since Dec. 2020. By the end of 2022, it was under $20,000.\n\nFortunes changed in 2023 as Bitcoin opened the year at a price of $16,530. It rose consistently throughout 2023, ending the year at $42,258.\n\nImportant On Dec. 5, 2024, Bitcoin reached and broke through $100,000 on nearly every exchange following news about the appointment of a crypto-friendly Securities and Exchange Commission Commissioner. It continuously breaks records following news releases, leading many to wonder what Bitcoin will do next.\n\n2024 Price History\n\nIn January 2024, the long fight for Bitcoin Spot ETFs came to a close after the SEC was forced by courts to review its denial of certain Bitcoin-related investment products. Some brokerages swarmed the market and increased their holdings, while others, like Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), experienced significant outflows at the onset.\n\nThe outflows from certain funds slowed going into March, somewhat settling the market. The market-wide rebalancing was likely because there were suddenly more options for investors to choose from.\n\nEarly 2024\n\nBitcoin's price climbed quickly after the fund approvals—in late February and early March, it once again breached $60,000, setting a high of $69,210 on March 6 and another of $70,184 on March 8. On March 1, Bitcoin continued setting records, reaching $73,835 on Coinbase.\n\nMid 2024\n\nOn April 19, 2024, Bitcoin had its fourth and latest halving event, reducing the reward for a mined block from 6.25 BTC to 3.25 BTC. The cryptocurrency recorded a modest gain that day and closed at $63,821.\n\nOn Sept. 18, 2024, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced its first rate cut since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, lowering the target federal funds rate to 4.75% to 5%.\n\nPredictably, the market had a positive reaction, with gains across major indices. Bitcoin also continued its trend of \"mimicking\" the stock market and, on Sept. 19, 2024, traded around $64,000, sharply higher than its price of about $60,000 just two days prior.\n\nLate 2024\n\nOn Nov. 7, 2024, Bitcoin's price hit another all-time high of $76,999 on Coinbase following Donald Trump's re-election as President before closing at $75,820, a 9% increase from the closing price on Nov. 5. On Nov. 10, 2024, Bitcoin reached another milestone, crossing the $80,000 threshold on Crypto.com ($80,152.38).\n\nOn Nov. 11, it continued pushing boundaries, and on the morning of Nov. 13, it made it past $91,000 ($91,203.83) on Coinbase. Market exuberance was unfaltering in the following weeks, pushing Bitcoin to unbelievable highs of $99,637 on Oanda, $99,543 on Coinbase, and $99,555 on Gemini on Nov. 22, 2024, by midday.\n\nAt about 3 p.m. ET, Bitcoin broke through $100,000 on a European exchange, Whitebit, and closed at $99,513.13.\n\nThese significant increases are due to investor exuberance following Trump's many promises on the campaign trail, such as replacing Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler, making America \"the crypto capital of the world,\" and creating a \"Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,\" among others.\n\n2025 Price History\n\nIn January 2025, Bitcoin experienced a somewhat lateral market, even after the announcement that Microstrategy purchased $1.1 billion BTC on January 21. That day, prices rose to $109,993 on Whitebit before settling to close at $106,749 on Whitebit on January 22.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, Bitcoin set another record, hitting $112,509.65 on Whitebit. As of June 2025, the price has come down, hovering at about $106,000.\n\n\n\nWhat Affects Bitcoin's Price?\n\nSupply and Demand\n\nLike other currencies, products, or services within a country or economy, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices depend on perceived value, supply, and demand. If people believe that Bitcoin is worth a specific amount, they will buy it, especially if they think its value will increase.\n\nBy design, only 21 million Bitcoins will ever be created. The closer Bitcoin gets to its limit, the higher, theoretically, its price should be, assuming all other factors remain the same. This limit is intended to keep increasing the value of Bitcoin over time as new coins become more and more scarce, putting upward pressure on demand.\n\nBitcoins are created by mining software and hardware at a specified rate. This rate splits in half every four years, slowing down the number of coins created. The last halving occurred on April 19, 2024. If events unfold the same way they have in the past, Bitcoin's price can rise again; however, there is no guarantee that the market will react the same.\n\nBitcoin's price should continue to rise as long as it continues to grow in popularity and its supply cannot meet demand. However, if popularity wanes and demand falls, there will be more supply than demand. Then, Bitcoin's price should drop unless it maintains its value for other reasons.\n\nNew Bitcoin Securities\n\nAnother factor that affects Bitcoin's price also relates to the supply and demand of related securities. Bitcoin became a financial instrument that investors and financial institutions use to store value and generate returns.\n\nAs a result, derivatives have been developed to broaden access to BTC for a wider range of investors. This also influences the demand for Bitcoins.\n\nSpeculation, investment product hype, irrational exuberance, and investor panic and fear can also be expected to affect Bitcoin's price because demand will rise and fall with investor sentiment.\n\nAs witnessed after the SEC approved Spot Bitcoin ETFs, regulatory activity causes market participants to take action. As new Bitcoin securities hit the market, Bitcoin's price will adjust due to the changes in supply and demand.\n\nBitcoin ETFs In January 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission authorized U.S. exchange-traded products to buy and hold Bitcoin directly on behalf of their investors. Before that, ETFs were only permitted to gain indirect exposure to bitcoin through futures contracts. In October 2024, the SEC approved options contracts on select spot Bitcoin ETFs. As of June 2025, there were 66 Bitcoin spot ETFs, with combined assets exceeding $138 billion.\n\nCryptocurrency Competition\n\nOther cryptocurrencies may also affect Bitcoin's price. The utility of cryptocurrencies as a whole continues to grow as regulators, institutions, and merchants address concerns and adopt them as acceptable forms of payment and currency.\n\nLastly, if consumers and investors believe that other coins will prove to be more valuable than Bitcoin, demand will fall, taking prices with it. Or, demand will rise along with prices if sentiment and trading move in the bullish direction.\n\n\n\nIs Bitcoin a Good Investment? Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency designed as a payment method. Investors and traders also began using it as an investment, but its price is highly volatile. This creates a significant financial risk. It is best to talk to a professional financial advisor about your specific circumstances and goals before buying Bitcoin as an investment.\n\nWhat Was Bitcoin's Best Price Ever? Bitcoin reached an all-time high price of $112,509.65 on May 22, 2025.\n\nHow Much Will 1 Bitcoin Be Worth in 2030? It's difficult to predict what one BTC will be worth at any given moment because it is such a volatile asset. By 2030, one bitcoin could be worth millions or nothing, depending on what happens. The primary factors that play a role in bitcoin's price are supply, demand, competition, and regulation.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nSince its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has remained a popular and closely followed asset and continues to demonstrate highly volatile price action. If past and recent events and prices are any indication, we can expect the volatility to continue as long as there is demand for it as an investment asset.\n\n\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

    "title": "Bitcoin's Price History With Charts From 2009 To 2025",
    "main_content": "Bitcoin’s price has been on a roller-coaster ride since it first debuted in January 2009, but the long-term trajectory has been higher — “up and to the right,” as they say. Bitcoin ushered in the age of cryptocurrency, but it took quite a while before the public sat up and took notice.\n\nStill, in little more than a decade, cryptocurrency, and in particular, Bitcoin, has become one of the most exciting trading opportunities in a long time. Bitcoin trading has created millionaires, though given that persistent rise since its debut, plenty of traders would have done fine just holding — or HODLing — on for the ride, as many long-term bullish owners have done.\n\nDespite the long-term rise, Bitcoin has been dogged by periods where it’s fallen precipitously. The most recent has been from November 2021 through 2022, when the prospect of rising interest rates and reduced liquidity in the financial markets sent Bitcoin’s price much lower.\n\nBitcoin was unleashed in the months after the global financial crisis obliterated economies. It was created by a mysterious individual or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto, and early proponents touted the currency’s promise of moving monetary policy out of the hands of governments and central banks and into an autonomously managed system.\n\nBitcoin famously has a maximum of 21 million coins that can ever be created. In the face of this fixed supply, an ever-increasing demand can send the cryptocurrency soaring. Given these dynamics, speculators have rushed into the space to take advantage of the anticipated price appreciation.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin is notoriously driven by sentiment. When the market shifts to its “greed” phase, Bitcoin soars amid the utopian promises and speculators dismiss the risks of an asset that generates no cash flow. In the “fear” phase, Bitcoin’s price seems to find no traction, as sellers push its price lower amid bad news or general market malaise.\n\nAmid all of this speculation, however, it’s important to remember that Bitcoin is tough to use for everyday purchases. Major companies that introduced ways to pay with Bitcoin have quietly walked back those initiatives. Now the market has rewritten the narrative from Bitcoin as a medium of exchange to one where it’s a store of value, “digital gold.” However, gold has a few thousand years of history as a store of value, compared to little more than a dozen for Bitcoin.\n\nIf you’re considering holding Bitcoin or other digital assets in your portfolio, it may be helpful to meet with a financial advisor to see how cryptocurrencies fit into your overall financial plan.\n\nHere’s how the price of Bitcoin has risen and fallen over time as well as some of the trends driving those moves.\n\nJanuary 2009 — July 2013: Bitcoin is created and attracts techies\n\nThe New Liberty Standard Exchange recorded the first exchange of Bitcoin for dollars in late 2009. Users on the BitcoinTalk forum traded 5,050 bitcoins for $5.02 via PayPal, making the first price mediated through an exchange a bargain basement price of $0.00099 per bitcoin. In other words, the price was about one-tenth of one cent.\n\nWhile Bitcoin was officially launched on January 3, 2009, it’s tough to find any standard pricing before mid-2010. That’s because there weren’t exchanges in the same way that there are today. However, data became available in July 2010 and continues to this day.\n\nIt was in 2010 that the most expensive pizzas of all time were purchased. One Bitcoin owner offered 10,000 bitcoins for two pizzas, an offer that continues to live on in Bitcoin lore. It’s considered the first time that anyone used virtual currency to buy something in the real world.\n\nAccording to historical data at Investing.com, Bitcoin’s price never broke above $0.40 per bitcoin in 2010 but did manage to hit that level in early 2011. Then in February, it crossed $1. Just a few months later, in May, it briefly exceeded $8 — a stunning 8-bagger in mere months!\n\nBy June 2011, Bitcoin’s price had hit nearly $30, a seemingly unimaginable rise from just months before. And that’s where it topped out for the year. Bitcoin spent the remainder of 2011 just dwindling to as low as $2, before finishing the year at $4.70. After this bubble burst and a more than 90 percent fall from its all-time high, it might have seemed as if the Bitcoin fad was over.\n\nIn 2012, Bitcoin spent much of the year consolidating, slowly growing stronger throughout the year. In November 2012, Bitcoin went through its first “halving,” a change in the reward structure for miners, where they receive half as many bitcoins for mining blocks on the blockchain. As 2012 came to an end, Bitcoin finished at $13.50, just off the highs for the year.\n\nThat consolidation set up Bitcoin for a strong run in 2013 when it began to attract more notice outside a niche audience of techies and hobbyists. The world’s first Bitcoin ATM was installed in Vancouver, allowing buyers to change fiat money for crypto. By the end of January, Bitcoin’s price had already risen to more than $20. The momentum built from there, as interest spread.\n\nBy early March, Bitcoin had already doubled again, rising to more than $40. A couple of weeks later it surpassed $50, and then days later $60. It climbed to $70 the day after that. By the start of April 2013, Bitcoin had passed $100 in breathtaking fashion. Then eight days later it spiked to $230!\n\nFrom there, it was just a week until Bitcoin was back at $68, as the bottom fell out. But then a week later, it had doubled again and traded north of $150. After the strong trading action in April and May, Bitcoin spent June and July settling down. Surely this was the peak of insanity for Bitcoin volatility.\n\nAugust 2013 — December 2017: Bitcoin breaks through to popular consciousness\n\nAfter months of consolidating from its rise earlier in the year, Bitcoin reached new heights in November 2013. Priced at $213 entering the month, Bitcoin doubled to nearly $435 just 12 days later. By the end of the month, it had nearly tripled from there, up to more than $1,200, before ending the year at $805, a real downdraft, but still up from just $541 a couple of weeks before. Late in the year, the People’s Bank of China banned financial institutions from using bitcoins.\n\nThe year 2014 saw Bitcoin retain its signature volatility. After hitting $1,000 in early January, Bitcoin bottomed at $111.60 on Feb. 21 — a decline approaching 90 percent! Behind the turbulence were problems at Mt. Gox, one of the earliest crypto exchanges. The exchange had stopped withdrawals, then filed for bankruptcy after losing 744,400 bitcoins of users’ funds.\n\nThen a mere five days later, Bitcoin recorded a price of $593.10 — more than a 5-bagger in days! Bitcoin spent the rest of the year gradually declining and closed 2014 at about $318.\n\nThe year 2015 started with Bitcoin declining, but most of the year was a slow uptrend, unusual for Bitcoin, and it ended the year at $430. In November, the official Bitcoin B symbol was adopted.\n\nThe first half of 2016 continued the same, with relatively muted volatility and price consolidation. But by the end of May, the price was picking up and by mid-June, Bitcoin was hitting $700. It didn’t last, though, and Bitcoin was back in the $600s until November 2016. It peaked back over $700 and then quickly $800 and $900. As the year ended, Bitcoin was flirting with $1,000, a level it broke through in early 2017, a watershed year for Bitcoin when it came to national awareness.\n\nThe year 2017 started off slowly enough, with Bitcoin wavering between $1,000 and $1,200. But by late April, the digital currency was clearly moving higher. The end of May saw Bitcoin at $2,300, but despite a move higher, it was back below $2,000 by mid-July. The decline didn’t last. By mid-August, Bitcoin had powered through $4,000 and then much higher. Retail traders were suddenly aware of the cryptocurrency and were driving volumes and prices higher.\n\nIn September, Bitcoin consolidated around $4,000 before moving decisively higher to $5,000 and then $6,000 in mid-October. The price of $7,000 was breached on Nov. 2, and then Bitcoin spent the rest of the year melting up: A couple of weeks later Bitcoin passed $8,000, then $10,000, surging to $13,000 days later, eclipsing $16,000 and by mid-December topping out above $19,000.\n\nIn December, Bitcoin futures began trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, helping drive further interest and dollars to the cryptocurrency.\n\nIt was a perilously quick rise for Bitcoin that became self-sustaining. As the news spread, more people rushed in to buy, sending the price seemingly ever higher. But Bitcoin finished the year off its highest levels, ending the breakthrough year of 2017 at $13,850.\n\nJanuary 2018 — December 2020: Bitcoin recovers and soars even higher\n\nAfter the huge melt-up of 2017, Bitcoin spent most of 2018 in a downtrend, falling throughout the year, following a brief surge to start the year. By the end of the first quarter, Bitcoin was down nearly 50 percent from where it had started the year. It spent much of the year bouncing between $6,000 and $8,000 before closing 2018 at $3,709 — down 73 percent for the year.\n\nThe year 2019 kicked off with more of the same, as Bitcoin looked for direction. It tried to burst through $4,000 for the first few months, but finally hit it in April and then rose to $5,000. May came and Bitcoin reached $6,000, then $7,000, then $8,000 before settling back in early June. That month Bitcoin swiftly spiked to $13,000 before coming back.\n\nBy September, Bitcoin was back solidly under $10,000, and it continued to search for direction and fell until the end of the year, finishing out 2019 at just under $7,200.\n\nBut with the turn of the calendar to 2020, Bitcoin picked up, rising over the next six weeks to above $10,000. In the midst of the stock market downturns during the initial COVID-19 pandemic wave, Bitcoin wavered, falling to $8,000. Then during the drawdown, it plummeted on March 12, 2020 — from $7,935 to $4,826 in a single day, a decline of more than 39 percent!\n\nBy early April, it was back above $7,000, then $8,000 and finally began pushing $10,000 in May. After dawdling for a couple of months, it finally rose to more than $11,000 in July and $12,000 in August. It settled over the next few months, until October, when it pushed through $13,000 again and ultimately vaulted to nearly $20,000 in November 2020, as financial markets tore higher on liquidity from the Federal Reserve and the prospect of a COVID vaccine.\n\nBitcoin raced higher during December 2020 and closed out the year at $28,949.\n\nJanuary 2021 — December 2023: Bitcoin gets pressured\n\nAfter what can only be described as a thrilling end of 2020 for Bitcoin, the digital currency started 2021 with a bang. The cryptocurrency climbed to start the year, peaking above $64,000 by mid-April, following a strong first quarter. Promises of seemingly never-ending liquidity from the Federal Reserve gave markets — both crypto and stocks — unbridled optimism.\n\nAfter this auspicious start to the year, there seemed to be only one place to go: down. In May, China warned cryptocurrency buyers that it was going to put pressure on the industry, and the price of Bitcoin began to drop. The country also announced that it was prohibiting financial institutions and payment platforms from transacting in cryptocurrency.\n\nThis news helped throw Bitcoin into a tailspin, where it quickly lost more than 50 percent of its value within a few months.\n\nLater, in September, China announced that all cryptocurrency transactions were illegal and that even foreign websites offering such services to Chinese traders were prohibited. The market shrugged off that news, and by October the currency was back over $60,000 and on its way to a new all-time high, at $68,789, on Nov. 10, 2021.\n\nLate in 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that it would begin to taper its bond purchases, slowly draining liquidity from financial markets. With inflation roaring at multi-decade highs, the central bank wanted to tamp down rising prices. The 10-year Treasury rate began to rise, as investors began pricing in the prospect that the Fed would raise interest rates in the near future.\n\nThe prospect of less liquidity in the market threw risky assets such as high-growth stocks for a loop, and cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin followed along, starting in early November.\n\nThat malaise continued into 2022, as rising inflation and a central bank intent on raising rates to thwart it, drove investors from risky assets. Bitcoin bounced around the $40,000 mark for months, but as the Fed started to aggressively raise interest rates in March, it began to sink. In mid-2022, Bitcoin established a new trading range of around $20,000 but then sank to less than $16,000 as high-profile blow-ups such as FTX hurt traders’ confidence.\n\nThe price picked up in 2023, gaining more than 50 percent through mid-June, amid a broader rally in tech stocks. Bitcoin traded for around $26,000 as of mid-June 2023 despite a crackdown by the Securities and Exchange Commission on the crypto industry. It bounced around but was still near $27,000 by late September, before it began to break higher to end the year.\n\nAs interest rates seemed to be peaking in October 2023, Bitcoin started rising again. It ran to more than $42,000 to close out the year, amid rumors that the SEC would finally allow the creation of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nJanuary 2024 — July 2025: Bitcoin ETFs and Trump help Bitcoin prices soar\n\nAfter some months of speculation, the SEC officially permitted Bitcoin to be traded in an ETF, and 11 fund managers were allowed to list funds. Bitcoin ETFs then began trading on Jan. 11, 2024. Bitcoin peaked at nearly $49,000 in the days leading up to the announcement, but cooled somewhat in the weeks following.\n\nMoney poured into the newly created Bitcoin ETFs in 2024, pushing the price of Bitcoin to a new all-time high above $73,000 in March. The summer months saw the price of Bitcoin retreat, trading mostly in the $60,000 range and falling below $55,000 in September.\n\nIn December, the price of Bitcoin soared to new highs, topping $100,000 for the first time, amid market enthusiasm following the election victory of crypto-friendly former President Donald Trump. In January 2025, Trump signed an executive order focused on digital assets that established a working group charged with proposing regulations for the crypto industry.\n\nBitcoin declined in March 2025 after the creation of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, as traders were disappointed by the lack of specific plans for how the U.S. would buy crypto for the fund. But by May, the cryptocurrency was setting a new all-time high, surging past $111,000, albeit briefly, before falling back.\n\nBitcoin returns by year\n\nYear Return 2009 N/A 2010 30,203%* 2011 1,467% 2012 187% 2013 5,870% 2014 -61% 2015 35% 2016 124% 2017 1,338% 2018 -73% 2019 94% 2020 302% 2021 60% 2022 -64% 2023 156% 2024 121% 2025 (YTD) 15% *Based on 2009 price from New Liberty Standard Exchange\n\nSource: Calculations based on data from Investing.com\n\n— Bankrate’s Brian Baker, CFA, contributed to an update of this article.\n\nEditorial Disclaimer: All investors are advised to conduct their own independent research into investment strategies before making an investment decision.
